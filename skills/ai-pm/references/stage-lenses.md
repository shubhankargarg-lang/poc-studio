# Stage lenses — what the AI PM checks at each gate

Each lens has three parts, run in this order:

1. **Re-run (mechanical).** Re-run the stage's own checks yourself. Never trust a check result, score or
   screenshot the author pasted. A self-reported result that your re-run contradicts is a finding on its own (R9).
2. **Judge (PM).** The questions a script cannot answer, read from the artifact and screenshots.
3. **Never a finding.** Standing decisions and deliberate limits. Raising them burns a round for nothing.

Every finding carries a **fix line** a producer can apply without asking a question:
`<where: section / page / specimen / scene id> — <what is wrong, with evidence> — <exact change>`.
Bad: "Improve the executive summary." Good: "§1 para 1 — opens with the as-is process ('Today, merchandisers…') —
open with P1's cost: 'Range reviews slip two weeks every season because…' (E4)".

Before judging, read the lessons for this stage (`lessons.md`, filter `stage:`) and the owner's profile. Every lesson
is a check. A finding that a lesson caught cites it (`precedent: [L-012]`).

## requirement-gathering (kind: requirements)

**Re-run:** list `files/`; confirm every file named in the document exists and every file in `files/` is named.

**Judge:**
- Is the **pain** stated in the client's own words, with who suffers and what it costs? Or only the ask?
- Is the **use case** held to this one? Material from the client's other use cases is listed as "not used", not mixed in.
- Are the **stated asks verbatim** (quotes, with source)? A paraphrased ask is a finding: later stages trace to it.
- Does every gap carry the question that would close it, and a default the run will use meanwhile?
- Is there enough to find a **wow moment**? If the document gives scoping nothing to build a demo climax around,
  say so as a `check_this` decision, not a block.

**Never:** a "Not ready" verdict in the document (that is the person's call at the gate); thin input.

---

## scoping (kind: plan for Part A, spec for Part B)

**Re-run:**
- `python3 _working/check_docx.py 02-scoping/scoping-document.docx` must print `ok`.
- `python3 <skill>/scripts/scope_metrics.py 02-scoping/scoping-document.docx` — sizing, L1 share, slop hits,
  §1 opening line, §20.2 storyline steps.

**Judge (Part A):**

| Lens | Question | Typical blocking finding |
|---|---|---|
| The wow | Does §1 open with the pain? Is there one moment in §20.2 the client's sponsor would retell to their boss? Is it live on screen, not a seeded replay? | Storyline is a feature tour; the core action re-shows a seeded result |
| Prioritisation (adversarial) | Re-test every L1 row as a sceptic: drop it — does the client lose an ask, does the core flow or an agent break, or does research say the demo looks incomplete? If none, it is L2. | L1 share > 50%; sizing over budget (pages > 6 per app, objects > 12, agents > 1 without a Decision) |
| Relevance | Does every L1 feature trace to a P-ID, a stated ask or research must-have? Is anything impressive but unrequested? | Untraced module; a supporting check grown into the app's centre |
| Journey integrity | Does L1 touch every stage of 8.1 at least thinly? Is exactly one persona Primary, with a task-led home? | One module is the whole app; a KPI-tile home |
| Assumption risk | Rank 5.6 by impact-if-wrong. Any assumption that would change the data model or the storyline must be researched, not assumed. | High-impact volume or process assumption, never challenged |
| Language | Client vocabulary everywhere (Appendix B)? Any slop from D1–D7? | Executive summary that could be about any client |
| Seed realism | Hero records use real brands and products; every warning, gate block and copilot answer has a planted defect | A gate block with nothing seeded to trigger it |
| Buildability | Computed values written by a workflow (no formula fields); one picklist/lookup convention; object prefixes; code app where the UI needs it | A badge with no workflow writing it |

**Judge (Part B):** only completeness and consistency with Part A. Detail is expected, never a finding.

**Never:** Part B length or detail; a design choice that the design-system skill owns (colour, theme, typeface);
a cut that a human decision approved.

---

## design-system (kind: design)

**Re-run:**
- Render the HTML with Playwright in light and dark, at 1280×800, 1280×680 and 375×812.
- Run `scripts/render_check.js` (the design-system skill's own render check) in each. Any non-zero count is a finding
  with its `where` list.
- Count by script: component pages, `<template class="device">` screens (≤ 5), `#style-sets` with one active set,
  `data-active` on every specimen, every L1 feature ID and CMP ID from the scoping doc present in the page inventory.
- Exact wording: every quoted refusal/message in scoping §8.2 appears verbatim in the flow diagrams.

**Judge (from your own screenshots, not the skill's):**
- **Independent design score**, 1–5 on the skill's five dimensions (distinctiveness, hierarchy, rhythm, finish,
  concept). If yours is more than 1 point below the skill's self-score on any dimension, that is a finding with the
  screenshot as evidence. Distinctiveness or finish under 4 by your score is blocking.
- **Logo-off test, done by you.** Cover the logo on the main screen. Compare against the last design systems
  recorded in `lessons/recent-looks.md`. Same chrome + surface + layout as a recent client = finding.
- **Brand check.** Fetch the client's live site once; compare hue family, light-to-dark balance and chrome choice
  with the expression card. A black-led brand shipped on a colour rail is blocking.
- **Concept visible.** The design concept on the expression card shows in the signature components, not only the card.
- **Profile rules.** Owner's profile items (e.g. no coloured side stripes: reject a `TB` status-stripe variant in the
  active set).
- **Weakest part.** Read the skill's own "weakest part" answer. Fixable inside the run → finding. Not fixable → carry
  it to the gate summary.

**Fix lines** name the section and specimen, and the request says: "fix only what is listed; leave everything else
byte-for-byte". A full re-run of the design system for a few findings is a wasted hour.

**Never:** the five-screen limit; the skill's steps; a brand settled by its source order; the labelled UnifyApps
stand-in logo; the public Orbit upload.

## build — Stage 4b (kind: build)

Runs after UnifyApps Headless's own parallel testing (`04-build/test-report.md`) and before publish. Its test is the
first pass; this is the independent one. The app is opened from `app.preview_url` with the saved Orbit session.

**Re-run:**
- `node scripts/build_walk.mjs --url <preview_url> --storage <orbit session json> --routes 04-build/routes.json --out reviews/build-walk-<n>`
  walks every page in scoping §11 nav order at 1280×800, opens every tab, and writes per page: screenshot,
  render-check counts, visual-acceptance checks (horizontal scroll, row height ≤ 64 px, rows visible ≥ 8, wrapped
  pills), raw values on screen, disabled buttons without a reason, side stripes, console errors, failed requests,
  and every visible string (`copy.json`).
- Reconcile counts: every rail badge and KPI tile number equals its page's row count (from the walk's numbers).

**Judge:**
- **Storyline.** Walk scoping §20.2 step by step on the screenshots. Each step: right page, right record in the right
  state, the proof visible without extra clicks.
- **Fidelity (R8).** Each page's pattern matches its `#build-plan` entry; only active variants; tokens only; agent in the
  drawer. Compare side by side with the drawn screens.
- **Copy lens.** Read `copy.json` against the glossary (scoping Appendix B) and slop C1–C7: one name per thing,
  outcome-named buttons, exact refusal wording, no jargon, sentence case.
- **Reverse trace.** Anything visible that no L1 feature asked for (extra tab, extra page, extra chart) is a finding:
  remove it.
- **Test-report honesty.** Anything `test-report.md` marks pass that the walk shows broken is a blocking R9 finding.

**Fix route:** findings go to UnifyApps Headless in the same session as numbered fix lines, as direct changes through
`ua-change` (no new plan), independent fixes in parallel; a platform asset it cannot build goes to platform-master's
browser fallback. At most 3 rounds per item; then the walk re-runs on the pages the fixes touched.

**Never:** design decisions already approved in the design system; seed records the person created while verifying.

---

## collaterals (kind: deliverable)

**Re-run:** `python3 kit/check.py` (must report 0 must-fix); read `review/v<n>/report.md` and the contact sheet;
render the deck and script PDF to images and look at every page.

**Judge:**
- **Opening.** The first narration line names the client's pain (RG pain points), not a feature (K1).
- **Wow by 1:30.** The core action from scoping §20.2 lands before 90 s in `build/placed.json` (K2).
- **Every number** on a slide or in narration is in `facts.json` or on its screen; big stats are outcomes (K4).
- **One subject, one story** across video, script and deck: same record, same numbers, same names.
- **Ending.** Next steps are the client's path, not our fixes (K6). Length 4–5 min unless the brief records why.
- **Preview link** frames only: no Matrix login or user-creation screen anywhere (blocking R9).

**Never:** the bundled template; the voice; the absence of a walkthrough PDF or a swimlanes document.
