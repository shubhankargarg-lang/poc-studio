# Design system for a POC

**Input: a scoping document (or BRD), a client name and a website. Output: a measured design system
that looks like it was made for this client.** Everything between is a pipeline you run, not a method
you interpret.

**A design system is not drawn, it is transformed — and then it is expressed.** We own a validated
one. The job is to move it onto the client's colour without breaking a single measurement in it
(the core), and then to choose, from variants this file already carries, the shell, chrome, surface
and voice that make it read as the client's own product (the expression). **The core never varies.
The expression always does.** Two clients who get the same expression need a reason on the page.

**Run this as Phase 3a — before any screen is drawn, before the first builder prompt.**

> **What this version adds (read once).** The original pipeline below — sample, harvest, transform,
> audit, ship — is unchanged and authoritative; every Step and the REFERENCE doctrine stand as
> written, except where v5 (items 6 to 11) names the change. The layers on top:
> 1. **Phase 0 — the selection engine** (new, runs before THE RUN): read the BRD, decide which views
>    and components this build needs, and stay in scope.
> 2. **The view library** (in REFERENCE): a reserve of view-types the system can produce — tables,
>    the chart/graph/flow/map engines, agentic and document views — most dormant on any given build,
>    surfaced only when the BRD calls for them. **A view the system does not carry is a view the app
>    can never build**; that reserve is what stops every output collapsing to a table-and-chart.
> 3. **The full component inventory + the universal state rule** (in REFERENCE): every atom the views
>    are built from, each specified across every state (border, hover, active, inactive, focus,
>    disabled, loading, error, selected, read-only).
> 4. **Getting outside facts** (next section): a mandatory research plan, with seven questions every run
>    asks plus the ones the BRD raises, each done to a minimum depth and recorded in a ledger. Every
>    question goes to the `research` skill first; if it fails or falls short, the skill searches on its
>    own until the minimum is met.
> 5. **The finished-piece rule** (just before the hand-over): what this skill hands over is final. It
>    needs no rework. Phase 0 writes a view manifest (0.6), every row of it gets a drawn specimen,
>    and the result is checked against a fixed list before it goes out.
>
> **v5 — written after four real runs (Pentland, ClickUp, Vermont, Topcon) where every app came out
> looking like the same product in a different hue, the Copilot sat on a page as a card, Pentland's
> black-and-lime brand shipped electric blue, the user journeys were never drawn, and the dark theme
> read as dull slate:**
>
> 6. **Journeys become drawn flows** (0.7): every journey in the scoping document is drawn as a
>    storyboard of screens, with each step's action, response, exception and interaction.
> 7. **Signature components in depth** (0.8): the two or three components the domain is really about
>    get a full specification and a deep specimen, not a generic tile.
> 8. **The agent drawer** (0.9, REFERENCE): every agent opens in a drawer or side panel built on the
>    platform's live agent component. Never a card on a page.
> 9. **The expression** (Step 2c, and the expression kit after the stylesheet): shell, chrome,
>    surface, default theme, type voice, imagery, motif and chart voice are chosen per client from
>    evidence, so no two clients look alike. The core rules do not move.
> 10. **Brand decided by a fixed source order** (stop 1, Step 1): an unattended run never settles a hue
>     conflict any other way, and achromatic, dark-led brands ship dark-led.
> 11. **A rebuilt dark theme, inspiration research and a build contract** (Step 5, research questions
>     6 and 7, Step 7): a deeper dark that passes everywhere, public design references on the page,
>     and the shell and agent rules the builder must follow so the app matches the system.
> 12. **v5.1 — consistency and density** (after the first v5 runs): every screen drawn in a device at
>     its real width; one overlay system (modal and drawer sizes, one anatomy); spacing and density
>     tokens; hard limits for tables and cards; coded variants with at most three style sets and one
>     active, readable by the builder; chart views; a render check that finds overlaps and squeezed
>     text.
>
> The design system is the app's entire vocabulary: the app composes only from what the system carries.
> So coverage is capability — but coverage is held in reserve and drawn on selectively, never all at
> once. Phase 0 decides what to draw; the transform pipeline skins it; the audit proves it.

# GETTING OUTSIDE FACTS · call the `research` skill

**Any web search or outside research this skill needs goes through the `research` skill first.** Run
your own searches only when `research` fails (see "When `research` fails" below). `research` searches, rates the sources and returns an answer with sources, dates,
a strength rating and any gaps. It stays inside the question it was sent. This skill decides what to do
with the answer.

**Reading the client's own site comes first, and research confirms it.** Steps 1, 2 and 2b fetch the
swatch, the linked stylesheet, the font files and the logo directly from the client's site. Research
then confirms what was sampled against a second source, and fills in what the site could not give.
Research also covers facts from outside the conversation: the client's business, an industry process,
a regulation, comparable products, design references, and the client's brand guidelines and tone.

## The research plan — mandatory, before Step 1

Research is not optional and not "when needed". Every run writes a research plan at the end of Phase 0
and completes it before Step 3 (the transform). The plan has two parts.

**Part 1 · Questions every run asks**, whatever the BRD says:

| # | Question | Depth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What are the client's brand colours? Confirm the hex values on an official source (the live site's CSS, a brand or press page) and a second independent source | Deep |
| 2 | Which typeface does the client use, who licenses it, and which open substitute matches it? | Deep |
| 3 | Where is the client's official logo file published (site, press kit, brand page, Wikimedia Commons)? | Deep |
| 4 | Does the client publish brand guidelines, and what do they say about tone, colour use and logo use? | Standard |
| 5 | What does the client do, for whom, and which words do they use for their own products, customers and processes? (feeds the sample content) | Standard |
| 6 | **Inspiration.** Which 8 to 12 public products and design references best show this domain and these surface archetypes done well? At least 2 from the client's own industry, 3 best-in-class products for the main archetype (0.2), 2 for each signature component (0.8), and, whenever dark is shipped, 3 well-regarded dark interfaces. For each: the link, what it does well, and the one idea worth borrowing | Deep |
| 7 | **Journey patterns.** For the signature journeys (0.7), how do the best products handle the same moments: the refused action, the approval, the hand-off, the empty first run, the AI suggestion the user accepts or rejects? | Standard |

**Part 2 · Questions the BRD raises.** Read the build brief and add a question wherever the BRD leaves
something the design depends on unsaid or thin. For example:

- personas or jobs are vague → who does this work in this industry, and what do they read most
- the BRD names countries, regulated data or languages → which privacy, accessibility and language rules
  apply, and how dates, numbers and names are formatted there
- an archetype from 0.2 is in play → 3 to 5 polished references for that archetype and data shape
- the BRD names a third-party product the app mirrors or connects to → how that product presents the
  same data, so the terms and statuses match

**A question is done only when it meets its depth:**

| Depth | Minimum before the question is done |
| --- | --- |
| Quick | 5 searches, the pages behind the answer opened and read |
| Standard | 10 searches, at least one official or primary source |
| Deep | 20 searches, at least one official or primary source, and every key fact confirmed by a second independent source |

**Questions 6 and 7 feed the design, not just the record.** Their answers become the **inspiration
board** on the style guide: each reference as a card with its link, what it does well, the idea taken,
and the component or expression choice it informed. Take ideas — layout moves, interaction patterns,
density, how a status or an agent is presented — never colours, logos, artwork or copied markup.
Nothing from a reference adds a colour value, radius or new rule to the core; it informs the
expression (Step 2c), the signature components (0.8) and the flows (0.7). A board of references that
changed nothing in the system is a list, not research.

**Keep a research ledger** and ship it in the port note: one row per question with its depth, the number
of searches run, the pages opened, the sources with dates, the strength of each finding, and the
answer. A row that has not met its minimum is not done. Keep searching (different phrasing, the
client's own subdomains, press releases, investor pages, app-store listings, archived copies, the
browser for pages a fetch cannot read) until it is. Only after the minimum is spent may a fact be
recorded as `[DERIVED]`, and the row then lists what was tried.

## What to send

When this skill needs facts it does not have, send `research`:

- **Question(s):** specific, one decision each
- **Purpose:** what this stage will decide with the answer, and whether it is an internal check, a
  working draft, or something the client will see
- **Context:** client, industry, country, earlier findings, and the build brief so far
- **Format:** the layout this stage needs, if different from the default

**Purpose sets how deep `research` searches**, so state it plainly:

| Purpose | How `research` works |
| --- | --- |
| Confirming one fact, or an internal yes/no check | Quick: about 5 to 10 searches |
| Feeding a working draft, such as a build brief section or a view choice | Standard: about 10 to 20 searches |
| Figures or claims the client will see (the type note, the hand-over), or a hard-to-reverse choice | Deep: 20 or more searches, every key figure confirmed by a second source |

A request that says only "research the client" gives `research` nothing to aim at. Ask for what one
decision needs, for example the roles that use a process and what each reads most.

## Where this skill asks

| Stage | Typical question | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0.1, BRD is thin | Which roles take part in `<process>`, what does each do daily, and what information does each read most? | Working draft: fills PERSONAS and JOBS |
| Phase 0.1, locale | Which privacy, accessibility or language rules affect screens that show `<data>` in `<country>`? | Working draft: fills REGION/LOCALE |
| Phase 0.3, choosing a view | Find 3 to 5 polished references for `<data shape>` and say what each does well | Working draft: view and density choice |
| Step 1, tone | What do `<client>`'s public brand and press pages say about tone, colour and typeface? | Internal check on Steps 1 and 2b |
| Step 2b, the type note | What licence covers `<candidate open substitute>`, and which typeface does `<client>` name for its brand? | Deep: the client reads the type note |
| Step 2c, expression | Find 8 to 12 public references for `<domain>` and `<archetype>`, plus dark interfaces if dark ships; say what each does well and the idea worth taking | Deep: shapes how the client's system looks |
| 0.7, journeys | How do the best `<archetype>` products handle `<moment>` (a refused move, an approval, an AI draft the user edits)? | Standard: shapes the flow and its interactions |

## Example requests

**Phase 0, thin BRD**
- Question: Which roles take part in `<process>` at `<industry>` companies in `<country>`, what does each
  one do daily, and what information does each read most often?
- Purpose: working draft. It fills PERSONAS and JOBS in the build brief.
- Context: `<client>`, `<industry>`, `<country>`, the BRD summary.
- Format: a table of role, daily job, information read, source.

**Phase 0, view references**
- Question: Find 3 to 5 polished `<surface type>` references for `<data shape>` and say what each does
  well.
- Purpose: working draft. It informs the choice of views and density for `<surface>`.
- Context: `<client>`, `<industry>`, the personas and jobs from the build brief.
- Format: for each reference, a link and the idea worth borrowing.

**Step 2b, type note**
- Question: Which typeface does `<client>` name for its brand, who licenses it, and under what licence
  is `<candidate open substitute>` available?
- Purpose: the answer appears in the type note the client will read.
- Context: `<client>`, the font loader found in the stylesheet.
- Format: face, foundry, licence terms, source.

## What comes back

Unless a different format is requested, each question returns:

```markdown
**Answer:** <2 to 4 sentences that answer the question directly>

**Findings**
| Finding | Source | Date | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|

**Gaps:** <what could not be found, and what could answer it>

**Notes for the caller:** <conflicts between sources, assumptions taken>
```

Strength is **Strong** (official or primary source, or two reputable sources that agree), **Medium**
(one reputable secondary source) or **Weak** (vendor marketing, gallery posts, unverified).

## Using what comes back

- **Treat it as a draft.** Check the gaps and the Weak findings before relying on them.
- **Close every gap and Weak finding the build depends on yourself.** Search and fetch the sources
  directly (see "When `research` fails" below) until the fact is confirmed. A Weak finding never
  becomes a stated fact until you have confirmed it. If your own search also finds nothing after the
  depth minimum is spent, make the decision, record it in the port note as `[DERIVED]` with the reason
  and what was tried, and keep going. **A gap is not a stop: the two stops in THE RUN stay the only
  two.**
- **Research never replaces sampling.** The brand colour comes from Step 1 and the logo from Step 2. A
  result that names a hex or a logo source is a lead to verify on the live site.
- **References inform the choice of view, never the system.** Nothing from a reference brings in a new
  colour value, radius or component. The stylesheet in Step 0 stays the system.
- **Record it.** The port note lists each question sent, the strength of each finding used, and the
  sources with dates. The type note and the build brief cite their sources.
- **Saving is this skill's job.** `research` returns its answer in the reply; this skill writes what it
  needs into the port note and the hand-over.

## When `research` fails

`research` is always the first call. **If it fails or falls short, do the rest of the research
yourself and carry on.** It has failed or fallen short when:

- the skill is not available in the session, or the call errors or times out
- it returns no answer, or only gaps, for a question the build depends on
- it returns only Weak findings for a fact the client will see
- its answer has not met the depth minimum in the research plan: fewer searches than the level asks,
  a deep fact resting on one source, or no official or primary source

Loading the `research` skill only loads instructions; the searching is still done in this run. So the
ledger counts the searches actually run, whoever ran them.

Then search with the web search and fetch tools directly. Work to the same standard `research` would:
open the pages you take facts from (a search snippet is not a source), prefer official and primary
sources, confirm client-facing facts with a second source, and record each source with its date in
the port note. Never stop the build or hand back an unfinished piece because `research` failed.

## Several questions

Send related questions in one request so `research` can reuse sources. Send unrelated questions as
separate requests, or run them in parallel with subagents and merge the answers here.

# PHASE 0 · Read the BRD, choose the system

**In the automated flow the BRD is a scoping document** — 80 to 130 pages, most of it data model,
workflows, business rules, agent prompts, seed data and sources. Read it as the BRD throughout this
file. Most of it is not visual, and that is exactly why it has to be read whole: the visual facts are
spread through it, and the journeys in it are the richest design input the system gets.

**This runs before THE RUN.** THE RUN (below) skins the system onto the client's brand. Phase 0 decides
*what gets skinned* — which views, which components, at what density — so the build matches the BRD
instead of defaulting to the same glass dashboard every time. If there is no BRD, only a client and a
website, skip to THE RUN and use the use-case dial defaults; Phase 0 is what a real requirement unlocks.

**The discipline is the same as Step 0's:** decide, record the decision, keep going. Phase 0 produces a
short **build brief** that every later step and the hand-over cite. It never asks the user more than the
two stops already allow.

## 0.1 · Parse the BRD into a build brief

**Read the whole BRD, end to end, before deciding anything.** Every section, table, appendix, data
model, automation, agent instruction and prompt, and every stakeholder note. Design facts hide in
unlikely places: a theme line in application settings, a chart tool in an agent's tool list, a status
value in a data model, a route list, an error message in a test case. Do not skim for the screens
alone. Record what you extract, mark anything you inferred `[DERIVED]`, and keep going.

```
DOMAIN          what the app is about (AP invoices, recruitment, churn, logistics…)
PERSONAS        who uses it, and their role (analyst, approver, exec, agent-operator, external user)
JOBS            the handful of things each persona comes to do
SURFACES        which surface archetypes the jobs imply (see 0.2)
SCREENS/ROUTES  every screen, route, overlay and modal the BRD names, including sign-in and recovery
VIEWS           which view-types the data and jobs require (see the View Library in REFERENCE)
DATA SHAPES     records · time series · relationships · stages/process · locations · documents · hierarchy
DATA VOLUMES    how many records, rows, items — decides paging, density and summaries
STATUSES        every status value and state word the BRD or its data model uses, in its own words
EDGE STATES     empty, no-results, loading, error, stale, locked, unset, no-access cases the BRD mentions
AGENT OUTPUTS   every agent and automation, its tools and what it can produce (see 0.3)
INTEGRATIONS    the systems the app reads from or writes to, and their terms
BRAND INPUTS    any colour, logo, typeface, theme, radius, tone or design system the BRD supplies
DEVICES         screen sizes, desktop or phone, light or dark
REGION/LOCALE   LTR/RTL, language, any compliance that touches the UI
CONTRADICTIONS  where the BRD disagrees with itself — each resolved and recorded as a derived decision
UNKNOWNS        what the design needs and the BRD does not say — each becomes a research question
OUT OF SCOPE    what the BRD does NOT ask for — stated explicitly
```

**When the BRD is a scoping document, read these sections for these fields** (section numbers follow
the usual template; find the equivalent if they differ):

| Scoping section | Feeds |
| --- | --- |
| Executive summary, context, pain points (§1–§3) | DOMAIN, the WOW factor, what the demo must prove |
| Scope, asked vs scoped, live vs simulated, decisions (§5) | OUT OF SCOPE, CONTRADICTIONS, what is real and what is staged |
| Research findings and brand cues (§6) | BRAND INPUTS, competitors for research question 6 |
| Personas (§7) | PERSONAS, DEVICES, density and shell per role (0.4) — every persona, not the first three |
| Journeys and workflows (§8) | JOBS and the flows in 0.7 — every journey, every step, every exception |
| Solution overview, global conventions (§9) | SURFACES, the app map, navigation, global elements |
| Feature catalogue and UI pattern coverage (§10, §10.5) | VIEWS; every must-have (L1) feature ID |
| Page specifications (§11) | SCREENS/ROUTES, layout order, key states per page |
| Data model, allowed transitions (§12) | STATUSES in their own words, state machines, UNSET fields |
| Agents (§13) | AGENT OUTPUTS, the agent drawers in 0.9 |
| Workflows, rules and scoring (§14) | refusal messages, gates, thresholds, what turns a status red |
| Roles and permissions (§16) | role shells, read-only states, no-access wording |
| AI trust and governance (§17) | the AI marker states, confidence display, human-in-the-loop moments |
| Non-functional notes, seed data (§18–§19) | DATA VOLUMES, sample content, hero records the specimens use |
| Demo storyline (§20) | which flows and screens carry the demo; the order the style guide follows |
| Hand-off to the design system (§21) | BRAND INPUTS, vibe, custom components, key states, interactions, layouts |
| Component inventory (§23) | signature-component candidates (0.8); every CMP ID gets a specimen |

**Every must-have (L1) feature ID and every CMP ID maps to at least one manifest row (0.6).** Nothing
the document builds now is moved to "future scope" by this skill. Where the document itself marks a
feature future scope, it stays dormant.

**Go beyond the document, inside its fences.** The scoping document is the floor, not the ceiling.
After the read, ask: what would make each persona's main journey faster, clearer or more convincing
in a demo? Add those as **proposals** — a view, a variant, a state, an interaction — drawn and labelled
`Proposed` on the page, each with the persona and journey it serves. A proposal never contradicts the
out-of-scope list, never adds a live integration, and never replaces what the document specifies.

**Correct the document where it would hurt the app.** Scoping documents are written fast and
sometimes ask for something that breaks a doctrine here — an agent as a full-width card on a page, a
status shown by colour alone, a drag with no keyboard path, a chart that colours a delta by its sign.
Follow the doctrine, draw it correctly, and record the correction in the port note with the line it
replaces. The document's intent wins; its wording does not.

**Where each fact comes from, in order:**

1. **The BRD.** What it states is used as stated. Research never overrides a requirement.
2. **The `research` skill**, for every UNKNOWN and for the seven questions every run asks (see the
   research plan).
3. **Your own web search and fetch**, when `research` fails or falls short, held to the same depth
   minimums and source standards.
4. **A derived decision**, only after 1 to 3 are exhausted, recorded with what was tried.

Brand inputs follow their own order — the brand source order in Step 1 — because a brand can be
current in two places at once (a deck and a website) without either being out of date. Where the BRD's
brand input is **demonstrably retired** (a rebrand dated after it, a logo the client no longer uses),
use the current brand, say so in the port note, and name the BRD line it replaces.

**The out-of-scope line is load-bearing.** It is how the build stays inside the requirement. A BRD for
an approval queue does not get a map, a chart wall or a chat just because the system can produce them.
Scope creep in a POC reads as "they didn't understand what we asked for."

⚠️ **A thin or messy BRD is the normal case, not an error.** Do not stop to interview the user; the two
stops in THE RUN are still the only two stops. Fill the gaps instead:

1. **Every empty field in the build brief becomes a research question** (Part 2 of the research plan),
   at standard depth. For example: no personas → who does this work in this industry and what do they
   read most; no statuses → which states this kind of record moves through in this industry; no
   volumes → typical record counts for a company of this size; no devices → where this kind of user
   works.
2. **Use what comes back to complete the brief**, marked `[DERIVED]` with its source, so the build
   brief has every field filled before Step 1.
3. **Sample content comes from research question 5** (the client's own business and terms), never from
   lorem ipsum or a generic company.
4. **Apply the floor below**, whatever the BRD leaves out.

**The floor — every build carries these, even from a one-paragraph BRD:**

- the app shell: left navigation with the logo, top bar, profile menu
- sign-in, with forgot-password and reset-password
- the main record list with its toolbar, search, filters and paging, and the record's detail view
- one primary form with validation, and every input state
- the four statuses (positive, attention, negative, neutral), named in the domain's own words
- empty, no-results, loading, error and no-access states, each with wording
- a toast with undo, and a confirmation modal for the one irreversible action
- light and dark, both reachable
- every component used, in every state of the universal state rule

The floor is the minimum, not a cap. Add what the brief and research call for; leave dormant what
neither does.

## 0.2 · Map to surfaces, then to views and components

The build brief resolves to a few **surface archetypes**. Each names a default set of views and
components pulled from the reserve. Everything not named stays dormant.

| Surface archetype | Default views it pulls | Use-case-dial row it inherits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dashboard / overview** | KPI tiles · charts · a table · maybe a feed | client-facing demo surface |
| **Dense ops console** | data grid (deep) · filters · detail/inspector · bulk actions | dense internal tool |
| **Record workspace** | master–detail · detail/inspector · activity feed · related records | dense internal tool |
| **Wizard / flow** | stepper · forms · review-and-confirm | demo surface |
| **Conversational / agentic** | copilot · agent run/trace · AI insight card · HITL approval | demo surface |
| **Map / geospatial** | map engine · legend · detail-on-select · filters | demo surface |
| **Process / workflow** | flow diagram · swimlane · kanban or stage board · stepper | dense internal tool |
| **Artefact / document studio** | document reader · studio shell · compare/diff | artefact / document studio |
| **Portal / external** | lighter nav · forms · status · help | demo surface |
| **Mobile-first** | single-column, touch targets, bottom nav | demo surface |

**A build is usually one or two archetypes, not all of them.** Pick the ones the jobs demand, inherit
their default views, then add or remove individual views by the data-shape rule in 0.3.

## 0.3 · The data-shape → view rule (how the right non-standard view gets chosen)

This is what makes the system produce a flow diagram instead of a table when a flow is what the data is.
Read the dominant data shape in each job and reach for the matching view from the library:

- **Many records, flat** → table / data grid. **One record, deep** → detail / inspector.
- **A value over time** → trend chart or timeline. **Many values compared** → comparison chart.
- **Parts of a whole** → part-to-whole chart. **Distribution / spread** → distribution chart.
- **Entities and their relationships** → node-link graph, tree, ER or dependency view.
- **A process with steps, branches or stages** → flow diagram, swimlane, kanban or stepper.
- **Things with a location** → map. **Things across time with duration** → Gantt / timeline.
- **An agent's work** → agent run / trace + HITL approval. **A long text or file** → document / code / preview view.
- **Two things to compare** → compare / diff view.

**Read what the agents and automations can output, not only the screens.** Go through every agent,
copilot and automation the BRD names, and list its tools and outputs. Each output type is a view the
system must style, even when no screen in the BRD shows it:

- a **chart** tool (generate chart, text-to-SQL with charts) → the chart engine: data palette, axes,
  legend and at least one chart specimen drawn inside that agent's pane
- a **file or document** output (generated letter, report, export) → document card plus the file viewer
- a **table** output → the in-chat data table
- an **approval or action** the agent proposes → the HITL approval view
- a **citation or source** output → citation chips plus the evidence hover card

"There is no trend data to chart" is not a reason to leave charts dormant when an agent can draw one.

**The reserve stays in the background.** A view-type is specified in the library but only instantiated
when the brief selects it. Holding thirty view-types does not bloat a build; selecting four does not
starve it.

## 0.4 · Persona → density, device and shell

Set the information density from the primary persona, then let the use-case dial and the density tokens
(REFERENCE) carry it:

- **Analyst / power user** → compact, keyboard-first, more on screen, fewer labels.
- **Occasional / external user** → spacious, guided, more labels and help.
- **Executive** → summary-first, few actions, headline numbers over raw rows.
- **Field / mobile user** → one column, thumb-reach actions at the bottom, large targets, glanceable
  status, camera and upload first, works in bright light.

**Then do it for every persona, not only the primary one.** Each persona gets a row in the build brief:
density, device and width (phone 375 px, tablet 768 px, laptop 1,280 px, wide 1,440 px), default theme,
and **its own shell** — which navigation it sees, what its first screen is, and how it reaches each
screen it uses. A persona who works on a phone or tablet gets real layouts at that width, with their
own navigation (bottom tabs on a phone, a collapsed rail on a tablet), not a desktop screen shrunk.
An external persona (customer, partner) gets its own lighter shell. **A persona whose screens are not
reachable from any drawn shell has not been designed.** On the style guide, draw phone and tablet
layouts as device specimens (`<template class="device">`, Step 0's kit), never as a narrowed `<div>`.

## 0.5 · Record the build brief on the page

The build brief ships in the port note (Step 7), alongside the colour decisions: the surfaces chosen,
the views drawn from the reserve, the density, and the out-of-scope line. A reviewer should be able to
see *why these views and not others* without opening the BRD. **The views you did not build, because
the BRD did not ask for them, are part of the record** — they show the scope was a decision, not a
limit.

## 0.6 · The view manifest — every item in the brief gets a drawn specimen

Before Step 1, turn the build brief into a **numbered manifest**: one row per surface, view, screen,
overlay and component the brief names, including every screen the BRD lists (sign-in, forgot password,
update password, file viewer, hover cards, confirmation modals) and every agent output from 0.3.
**Write it last in Phase 0**, so it also carries: one row per journey flow (0.7), per signature
component (0.8), per agent drawer (0.9), per persona shell and device layout (0.4), and per proposal.
Every L1 feature ID and CMP ID from the scoping document appears in the BRD-reference column of at
least one row.

| # | Item | BRD reference | Section on the page | Specimen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Forgot password screen | §9.1 routes | `#signin` | drawn |

**Ship the manifest on the page**, in the build brief section, with each row linking to its specimen.

**A specimen is the item drawn**: rendered with the client's content, in its real states, **inside the
app shell it lives in** (the rail or top bar, the header, the real page width), so the reviewer and
the builder see the screen, not a fragment floating on the guide. **Screens are drawn in a device
(`<template class="device">`) at their real width and scaled to fit** — never a full shell squeezed
into a narrow box. Journey storyboards (0.7) put at most two scaled desktop frames per row. Atoms (a button, a tag) may be shown
loose in the component section; screens, views, flows and drawers may not. These are not specimens: a row in the containers table, a line in the build brief, a "same layout as" note, a
nav item that names the screen, a token, or a sentence describing it. If the brief names it, the page
draws it. If something should not be drawn, it moves to the out-of-scope list with a reason, and the
brief stops claiming it.

## 0.7 · Journeys → drawn flows

**The journeys are where the scoping document already describes the design.** A journey table that
says *"clicks Move stage → refused: 'No approved Fit or SMS sample'"*, *"reject without a reason is
refused"* or *"tile 24 → 23"* is an interaction specification. Earlier runs drew the screens and never
the journey, so every refusal, hand-off and counter change was left for the builder to invent.

**Every journey in the document becomes a flow on the page** — a storyboard, left to right, one frame
per step:

```
FRAME      the screen as it looks at this step, in the shell, with the hero record's real data
ACTION     what the persona does (click, drag, type, approve, ask the agent) — marked on the frame
RESPONSE   what the system shows next: the new state, the toast, the moved card, the changed count
EXCEPTION  the refusal or error path the document names, drawn as its own frame with the exact wording
FEEDBACK   the interaction detail: what animates (120–160 ms), what gains focus, what announces to a
           screen reader, what undo is offered, what the keyboard path is
DATA       the record and the field that changed (from the journey's data column)
```

**Rules:**

- **Every step gets a frame; every exception gets its own frame.** A refused action is drawn refused,
  with the message the document gives, not described.
- **Consecutive steps on one screen share a frame** with the change shown as before → after.
- **Cross-persona hand-offs are drawn as hand-offs**: the end of one persona's flow and the start of
  the next (the brand manager approves; the rep sees it).
- **Where the document gives the step but not the screen state, derive it** from the page
  specification (§11), the rules (§14) and the data model (§12), and mark it `[DERIVED]`.
- **Where the document gives no journey for a persona, write one** from that persona's jobs and the
  page specifications, at least the persona's first session, and mark it `Proposed`.
- **The demo storyline (§20) is drawn as one end-to-end flow** across personas, in its order. It is
  the first flow on the page.

**Add the interactions the journeys imply even when they do not name them**: hover and focus on
everything clickable in the frame, the loading state between action and response, the empty state the
first time a persona arrives, and the undo after a reversible action. These come from REFERENCE and
research question 7, applied to this journey.

## 0.8 · Signature components — depth where it matters

**Every domain has two or three components that carry the product.** Shelf compliance has the shelf
photo with evidence boxes. Product creation has the colour-checked image studio and the stage gate.
Recruitment has the ranked shortlist with explained scores. Delivery has the risk grid and the change
approval chain. Generic parts — tiles, tables, tabs — are carried by the kit; signature components are
where the client sees that we understood their work.

**Choose them** from the scoping document's custom-component list (§21), the component inventory
(§23), the WOW factor in the executive summary and the demo storyline. Name each in the build brief
with the reason.

**Specify each one in depth, on the page:**

1. **Anatomy** — every part named, with the token it uses and its measured contrast.
2. **Every state** of the universal state rule, plus its domain states (for a shelf photo: analysing,
   scored, retake needed, low confidence, override pending).
3. **Data variants** — empty, one item, typical, many (the document's real volumes), overflow, very
   long text, missing image, the worst real record in the seed data.
4. **Interactions** — what each click, hover, drag and key does, with the keyboard path and the
   non-drag alternative; what is selected, what is linked (tap a finding ↔ highlight its box).
5. **Responsive** — how it reflows at each persona's device width (0.4).
6. **Motion** — what moves, why, how long; nothing decorative.
7. **AI behaviour** — where the AI marker sits, how confidence shows, how a person accepts, edits or
   rejects, what an AI failure looks like.
8. **Variants** — at least two layouts for different contexts (a full view and a compact card; a
   desktop panel and a phone sheet), so the builder has the right one for each page.

Draw each signature component large, with real seed data, in its states and variants. **A signature
component drawn once, at one size, in its happy state, is a generic component with a new name.**

**Signature components may introduce new composition** — a new layout of existing atoms, a new
overlay on an image, a new arrangement of a grid — but never a new colour value outside the transform,
a new radius, a third elevation or a new type size. That is where the expression of depth lives.

## 0.9 · Agents → the agent drawer

**Every agent the document names gets the agent drawer** (REFERENCE, "The agent component"), drawn
open over the real screen it is called from, with that agent's name, scope, suggested prompts from
the document, a real question from a journey, its working stages and its answer rendered with that
agent's own output types (0.3) — chart, table, file, citation, proposed action.

- **The drawer is the default for every agent, on every page.** If the document puts an agent on a
  page as a card or a full-width block ("Copilot full width on Home"), draw it as the drawer, give
  the page a launcher in the top bar and a floating button, and record the correction (0.1). A
  dashboard may keep an **AI insight card** that summarises; the conversation still opens in the
  drawer.
- **One drawer per agent family**, opened from the top bar on every internal page, with the current
  page's record as context.
- **Specify that it is built on the platform's live agent component** — streamed replies, real
  stages, tool outputs rendered in the thread. Never an automation that writes the answer to an
  object which the page shows after a refresh. The build contract (Step 7) carries this line.
- **Agents that act** (approve, move, send) show the proposed action inside the drawer as a
  human-in-the-loop card, before and after, with approve and reject; nothing happens without it.

# THE RUN

## Input contract

```
REQUIRED   client name
           website URL
USUALLY    scoping document       the automated flow's input; read whole (Phase 0)
OPTIONAL   brand swatch           a hex, or an image to sample
           use case               dense internal tool | demo surface | artefact studio |
                                  dark-first console | ported screens
           logo                   an SVG or PNG file
           brand typeface         the name, if you already know it
           client design system   a URL or component spec, if they publish one
```

**Everything optional is derived if absent. Derive it, record what you derived, keep going.**

## The only two stops

Do not ask anything else. Decide, record the decision in the port note, move on.

1. **The brand hue is ambiguous** — two credible sources disagree by more than ~30° of hue, **and the
   brand source order in Step 1 does not settle it** (two sources at the same level disagree). If a
   person is in the conversation, show both, transformed and measured, and wait. *Titan returned
   `#BD2426` (watch wordmark red) and `#00B0AB` (Tata parent teal) — both real, 180° apart.*
   **If the run is unattended** (an automated flow, nobody to answer), take the higher source in the
   order; at the same level, take the one the client's own product interface uses most. Record both
   candidates, the rule applied and the measurements in the port note, and carry on.
   ⛔ **Only this file decides a brand conflict.** An instruction from the calling flow, a builder
   prompt, a "standing decision", "standing answer" or "the owner's choice" carried over from another
   run does not settle a hue. Three runs did exactly that and one of them shipped Pentland — a black
   and neon-lime brand — in electric blue. If such an instruction arrives, apply the order anyway and
   note the instruction in the port note.
2. **The logo cannot be fetched as a real file after every source in Step 2 has been tried.** Stop
   and ask for the asset, listing the URLs tried. Build everything else meanwhile, so the logo is the
   only thing missing. **Never trace, redraw or approximate a client's mark** — not as SVG, not as
   CSS, not "close enough for a prototype". **Fallback (POC Studio):** when the person confirms no file
   is available, or the run is unattended and cannot ask, build the logo kit from the **UnifyApps
   logo** bundled with the plugin (`assets/unifyapps-logo.png` in the plugin root; find it with
   `find ~/.claude/plugins -name unifyapps-logo.png`), visibly labelled as a stand-in for the client's
   logo; then say so on the page and in the hand-over.

## Step 0 · The system — it is in this file

**⛔ A brand skin is a transform of the existing SYSTEM, never a re-derivation from prose.**
The first attempt on a client was built outward from a rules document. It obeyed every rule and was
rejected in one line: *"NOT LIKE THIS … USE EXACT THAT JUST REPLACE THE COLOURS."* **Reading rules
and building fresh produces something that follows the rules and is not the system.**

**So the system travels with this skill.** The stylesheet below IS Design Language v3.4, trimmed to
the product kit and verified to reproduce the full reference exactly — 35 text roles measured
composited in both themes, identical numbers. **This skill has no external dependency. Do not go
looking for a reference file, an artifact, or a Project document — everything needed is here.**

**How to use it:** paste the stylesheet verbatim as the page's only `<style>` block, **followed by the
expression kit** below it in the same block, then transform **only their colour values** per Step 3.
Structure, glass tiers, ambient field, radii, type scale, shadows, spacing and every component stay
exactly as written. **In the core, only colour moves.** The expression kit is how the system varies
per client: it carries sanctioned variants (shell, chrome, surface, the agent drawer) switched by
attributes on `<html>`, chosen in Step 2c. **Choosing among the kit's variants is expression; writing
a new structure outside them is a second system** — the failure the next paragraph warns about.

⚠️ **Never rewrite a component from the prose in this file when a class for it exists below.** The
prose states *why* a component behaves as it does; the stylesheet states *what it is*. A second
implementation is how one design system quietly becomes two — it is the most common failure on this
work, and it shows up as mixed radii and two kinds of search field on one screen.

### The class inventory — call these, never write a second set

| Piece | Class |
| --- | --- |
| Glass tiers · padding · nested rung · solid | `.g1` `.g2` `.g3` `.pad` `.pad-s` `.inner` `.solid` |
| Ambient field (3 fixed layers) | `.amb.a` `.amb.b` `.amb.v` |
| Type | `.title` `.micro` (mono eyebrow) |
| Buttons · tags · pips | `.btn` `.btn-p` `.btn-s` `.btn-t` · `.tag` + `.neutral/.attention/.negative/.positive` · `.pip` |
| Table toolbar · search · facet · card · grid | `.toolbar` `.field` `.chipsel` `.tblwrap` `.tbl` |
| Pagination | `.pg` `.pgb` `.rng` |
| AI Insight (scoped, see below) | `.ai:not(.msg)` |
| Tiles · loop strip · empty | `.tile` `.loop` `.empty` |
| Fused tabs | `.tabs` `.tab` `.tabpanel` |
| Forms | `.fld` `.ctl` (+`.focus/.err/.warn/.off`) `.hint` `.seg` `.tog` `.opt` `.box` `.dot` |
| Steppers · progress · reasoning stages | `.sth` `.stv` `.prog` `.stages` |
| Copilot | `.canvas` `.convo` `.msg.me` `.msg.ai` `.chips` |
| Kanban · calendar · agenda · slots | `.kb` `.cal` `.agenda` `.slot` |
| Person card · face stack · avatar | `.pc` `.faces` `.av` |
| Activity feed | `.feed` `.fi` `.fd` |
| Chart frame · sparkline · delta · legend | `.chart` `.spark` `.delta` `.legend` |
| Toast · menu · breadcrumb · note | `.toast` `.menu` `.crumb` `.note` |
| **App shell** (kit) | `.app` (+`.with-agent`, `[data-shell="top"]`) `.app-rail` `.brand` `.nav-i` (+`[aria-current="page"]`) `.prof` `.app-main` `.app-top` (+`.scrolled`) `.app-body` `.app-tabs` |
| **Agent drawer** (kit) | `.agent-launch` `.agent-drawer` (+`[data-open]`, `.wide`, `.docked`) `.ad-hd` `.ad-name` `.ad-tools` `.ad-ctx` `.ad-thread` `.ad-dock` `.ad-composer` `.ad-out` `.ad-action` `.ad-diff` |
| **Expression switches** (kit, on `<html>`) | `data-chrome="brand / ink / light"` · `data-surface="glass / solid / paper"` · `data-density="compact / comfortable"` · `data-style-set="S1/S2/S3"` · `data-theme` · `--font-display` · `--signal` · `--paper` |
| **Overlays** (kit) | `.scrim` · `.modal` (+`.s`, `.l`) · `.drawer` (+`.s`, `.l`) · `.ov-hd` `.ov-t` `.ov-sub` `.ov-x` · `.ov-bd` · `.ov-ft` (+`.lead`) |
| **Spacing and density** (kit) | `--s-1…--s-12` · `--page-pad` `--section-gap` `--card-pad` · `--row-h` `--cell-px` `--cell-py` · `--ov-s/m/l` `--ov-pad` · `--content-max` |
| **Dense data** (kit) | `.cl` `.cl2` (`--col-w`) · `.cell-chips` `.more` · `.tblwrap.freeze` · `.row-x` `.xp` · `.dl` · `.cv` `.cv-tag` |
| **Specimens** (kit) | `<template class="device" data-device="desktop / wide / tablet / phone">` → `.device-wrap` · `.devices` · `.frame` (components only) |

**Not in the kit, by choice** — the artefact studio, command palette, notification tray, diff view,
bulk bar, slider and file drop. They are rare enough that carrying them costs every run. **Build them
from the tokens and the doctrine in the REFERENCE section, never with new colour values**, and if one
recurs across two builds, add it to the kit.

⚠️ **`.ai` vs `.msg.ai`.** The AI Insight card is `.ai:not(.msg)` and agent chat bubbles are
`.msg.ai`. An unscoped `.ai` rule renders **every conversation turn as an AI Insight card** —
invisible in light, obvious in dark. The kit is already scoped; keep it that way.

### The stylesheet

**Paste verbatim. Measured in v5: the core carries 47 distinct hexes, 26 `rgb()`/`rgba()` triples and 9
bare `--aur` triple declarations; the expression kit adds 11 hexes and 7 triples. Inventory them,
transform them, diff the count afterwards.** (Earlier versions printed "54 hexes and 25 triples"; the
trimmed sheet never matched it, and three runs had to re-count. These are the measured numbers.)

```

**What the kit fixes, from the four runs:**

- **The rail runs the full height, always.** `.app-rail` is sticky at `height:100vh` inside a grid, so
  it never stops halfway down a long page (Pentland's rail ended at 750 px).
- **The top bar is opaque.** `.app-top` paints the solid rung over the page ground, so content never
  slides visibly under it and collides with the title (Pentland). Add `.scrolled` once the page has
  scrolled, for the shadow.
- **The agent is a drawer.** `.agent-drawer` slides in from the right over the page (the default),
  widens with `.wide` for charts and tables, or sits in the layout as a third column with `.docked`
  inside `.app.with-agent`. It is opaque, so text on it measures against one ground. On a phone it
  fills the screen.
- **Phone and tablet are part of the shell.** Under 1,100 px the rail collapses to icons (labels in
  `.lbl`, the wordmark in `.brand .word`); under 760 px it is replaced by `.app-tabs`, a bottom tab bar
  with 52 px targets.
- **In dark, the brand rail stays deep.** `--rail-deep` and `--rail-deep-2` are their own tokens in
  both themes (transformed like every other colour), so the rail does not turn pale when the dark theme
  lightens `--sp-deep`. No `color-mix()` anywhere: in a browser without it the rail rendered
  transparent.
- **Every screen is drawn at its real width, in a device.** Media queries answer the window, not a
  box, so a "1,280 px" screen drawn inside a 1,000 px guide column gets the desktop layout at the wrong
  width: the v5 runs squeezed state screens to one word per line and let a docked Copilot eat the page.
  **Every screen specimen** — desktop, wide, tablet, phone — goes in `<template class="device"
  data-device="desktop|wide|tablet|phone">`. The device script below renders it in an `<iframe>` at its
  true width (1,280, 1,440, 820, 390 px) with the page's own stylesheet, **scales it to fit the guide**,
  sizes desktop screens to their content height (`data-height="700"` fixes a height), and keeps the
  theme, chrome, surface, density and style set in sync. `.frame` remains only for a component shown
  without its screen.
- **Overlays share one system.** Modals (`.modal`, sizes `.s` 420 / default 560 / `.l` 760 px), side
  drawers (`.drawer`, same three sizes, always full height) and the agent drawer (420 px, `.wide` 760 px)
  use the same width tokens (`--ov-s/m/l`), the same anatomy (`.ov-hd` title and one line of support,
  `.ov-bd` scrolling body, `.ov-ft` footer with the primary action last on the right) and the same
  padding (`--ov-pad`, 24 px; 16 px on a phone). A modal never exceeds the screen height minus 64 px;
  its body scrolls. On a phone a modal becomes a bottom sheet and a drawer goes full width. `.scrim`
  dims the page under a modal, never under a drawer the person works beside.
- **The docked agent only docks when there is room.** `.app.with-agent` gives the drawer its own
  column at 1,440 px and wider; below that the same drawer becomes an overlay, so the page is never
  squeezed. The launcher hides while any agent drawer is open (place `.agent-launch` after the drawer).
- **Spacing and density are tokens.** `--s-1…--s-12` (4–48 px) is the only spacing scale; page padding
  `--page-pad`, gaps between sections `--section-gap`, card padding `--card-pad`. `data-density=
  "compact|comfortable"` on `<html>` moves row height (36 / 44 / 52 px), cell padding and card padding
  together; nothing else changes.
- **Table helpers for dense data.** `.cl` (one line with ellipsis, width `--col-w`), `.cl2` (two lines),
  `.cell-chips` with `.more` ("+2"), `.tblwrap.freeze` (first column stays while the table scrolls),
  `.row-x .xp` (an expanded row that holds what does not fit a cell). `.dl` is a definition list with a
  label column of 120–160 px. `.cv` and `.cv-tag` frame a chart view and its code.
- **Chrome is a switch, not a rewrite.** `data-chrome="brand"` (the house gradient rail), `"ink"`
  (near-black chrome with the brand's signal colour as the active indicator — for black-led and
  achromatic brands), `"light"` (the rail on the solid rung, the brand only on the active indicator).
- **Surface is a switch.** `data-surface="glass"` (the house look), `"solid"` (opaque cards, no blur,
  a quieter aurora — for dense tools and clients whose own product is flat), `"paper"` (solid cards on
  the client's own page ground `--paper`, no aurora — for print-like, editorial or very calm brands).

**The device script — paste once, inline, at the end of `<body>`:**

  function sync(){var h=document.documentElement;items.forEach(function(it){var d=it.f.contentDocument;if(!d||!d.documentElement)return;KEYS.forEach(function(a){if(h.hasAttribute(a))d.documentElement.setAttribute(a,h.getAttribute(a));else d.documentElement.removeAttribute(a)})})}
  new MutationObserver(function(){sync();items.forEach(fit)}).observe(document.documentElement,{attributes:true,attributeFilter:KEYS});
  if(window.ResizeObserver){var ro=new ResizeObserver(function(){items.forEach(fit)});items.forEach(function(it){ro.observe(it.wrap)})}
  else window.addEventListener('resize',function(){items.forEach(fit)});
})();
```

**Every colour in the kit is transformed with the core** in Step 3, and its ratios are measured in
Step 6 like everything else. The kit's literal blues follow the brand; the ink chrome's near-blacks are
near-neutral and barely move.

**Fonts as shipped:** Archivo 400/500/600 and IBM Plex Mono 400/500/600, both from Google Fonts and both openly licensed. **Archivo is the DEFAULT body face, not a fixed one — Step 2b decides whether it is replaced by the client's.** IBM Plex Mono stays. **If the mono is not
actually embedded, table headers fall back silently and the whole grid loses its register.**

⚠️ **Two token groups are declared as BARE triples** — `--aur-a` / `--aur-b` / `--aur-c`, consumed
as `rgba(var(--aur-a),a)`. **There is no `rgb(` to match, so a find-and-replace over hexes and
`rgba(...)` will skip them and leave the ambient field on the previous brand.** At 5% opacity that
does not look broken, it just casts the whole page in the wrong hue. Their hex equivalents are
`#0033A1` / `#0071CE` / `#CC27B0` in light and `#4C7FE8` / `#6BB3EA` / `#E884D6` in dark.

## Step 1 · Sample the brand

**The brand source order — highest first.** It decides every colour conflict; nothing else does.

1. **What the client supplied**: a swatch, the client's own deck or brand cues, a named brand system,
   the brand inputs and §21 hand-off of the scoping document when they come from client material.
2. **The client's published brand guidelines** or brand portal (colour pages, brand kit).
3. **The client's live product interface** — their own app or platform, when it is public.
4. **The client's live marketing site** — the CSS custom properties, the computed button and header
   colours.
5. **Third-party sources** (colour sites, logo libraries) — only ever as the confirming second source.

A source higher in the order wins even when a lower one is used more often. A retired source (a rebrand
dated after it) drops out of the order entirely. Record the order applied in the port note.

**Sample the identity, not only the hue.** A hue rotation alone produced four apps that looked the
same. Record each of these from the sources above; together they feed the expression (Step 2c):

- **Light-to-dark balance.** Is the brand light-led (white grounds, colour as accent), dark-led
  (black or near-black grounds, as on Pentland's deck) or colour-led (large fields of brand colour)?
- **The brand's chromatic role.** One hero colour, a pair, a gradient, or achromatic (black, white,
  grey) with a single accent? **An achromatic brand's "brand colour" is its black**, and its accent is
  the signal colour. Do not promote a link blue from the site into the brand.
- **The accent and where the client uses it** — buttons only, highlights, data, illustration.
- **The neutral ramp** — warm, cool or pure grey; the client's page background.
- **Shape and line** — square or rounded, hairlines or shadows, flat or layered, as their own product
  draws them (this informs the expression only; the core radius scale does not move).
- **Imagery** — product photography, people, illustration, data, none; and its treatment.
- **A motif** — a shape, line, angle or pattern in the logo or brand work that can become one quiet
  graphic element (a chevron, an oval, a stripe).
- **Type voice** — the display face and how loud headings are.

* **On the live site, read the CSS custom properties off `:root`** — not a screenshot. *On
  daikincomfort.com they are literally `--daikin_blue`, `--daikin_orange`, `--daikinGradient`.* Take
  the neutral ramp too. **From brand guidelines, take the digital (screen) palette**; a print primary
  (Pantone, CMYK) is not the screen colour the client means, as the next point shows. **The type stack is its own step — see Step 2b.**
* **🔴 A brand book's print primaries are not necessarily the hue the client means by "our colour".**
  Proofpoint's second attempt used H 196 — the hue of their own 5415 Blue — and was still wrong. The
  answer came as a swatch: *"Its more of sea green and bluish…"*, sampled as `#102F2D` off their live
  site. **When a swatch is available, sample it. Do not reason toward it.**
* **If the CSS cannot be fetched** (blocked, empty, or built by JavaScript), open the site in a browser
  (Claude in Chrome or the built-in browser) and read the values from the rendered page: the `:root`
  custom properties, and the computed colours of the primary button, links, header and nav. Do not
  fall back to a third-party colour site as the only source; use it as the second, confirming source
  in research question 1.
* **Inventory before transforming** — v3.4 carries **54 distinct hexes and 25 `rgb()` triples**.
  Count, transform, diff the count.

## Step 2 · Harvest the logo

**Acquisition, in order. Stop at the first that yields a real file:**

1. **Inline `<svg>` in the site header**, or a linked `.svg` (`/logo.svg`, `/assets/logo*.svg`) —
   always preferred; it scales and recolours cleanly.
2. `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` — usually 180px, square, the mark alone.
3. `<meta property="og:image">` — usually the lockup, often with padding to crop.
4. `/favicon.svg` or `/favicon.ico`.
5. **The rendered page.** If a direct fetch is blocked, empty or JavaScript-rendered, open the site in
   a browser (Claude in Chrome or the built-in browser, whichever the session has) and take the logo
   from the rendered DOM: the header `<svg>` markup, or the `src` of the header `<img>`, then fetch
   that URL.
6. **The client's other official sources:** press, media or brand-kit page (`/press`, `/media`,
   `/brand`, `/newsroom`), the logo on the client's own docs or support site, and the client's
   app-store icon.
7. **Public logo libraries that hold the official file:** Wikimedia Commons (the file the client's
   Wikipedia article uses), Brandfetch, Simple Icons. Use the file as published; record its URL and
   check it matches the mark on the client's live site.
8. **Ask.** See stop 2 — never trace.

**Work through every step before stop 2.** "Could not be downloaded into this workspace" after one
blocked fetch is not a reason to stop. Record every URL tried and what each returned in the port note,
so a reviewer can see the search was complete.

**Then derive the kit. Seven variants, because a navbar and a favicon are not the same problem:**

| Variant | Where it goes | Min size | Ground |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary lockup** | Login, splash, cover slide, document header | 140px wide | Light page only |
| **Horizontal lockup** | Product header, email signature | 110px wide | Light page or tier-1 glass |
| **Stacked lockup** | Narrow columns, print, square crops | 96px wide | Light page only |
| **Mark only** | Collapsed rail, tab strip, compact header | 24px | Any |
| **Reversed mono** | **The nav rail** — the one branded surface | 24px | Brand gradient |
| **One-colour** | Watermark, single-ink print | 24px | Any |
| **App / favicon** | Tab, bookmark, PWA | 16 · 32 · 180 · 512 | Its own |

**Rules, and they are measured like anything else:**

* **Clear space is half the mark's height on all four sides.** Nothing crosses it, including the
  product name.
* **The mark is measured at ≥ 3:1 against its ground.** It is a graphical object, not text — 3:1 is
  the bar, and it still has to be met, in every variant and both themes.
* **Account and org logos are circles** (given on SailPoint: *"the logo used should be circular"*).
  Crop to a circle; never letterbox a rectangle inside one.
* **🔴 The rail is a gradient, so the logo on it is REVERSED MONO** — not the colour version with a
  white plate or glow behind it. A knocked-out mark on the brand gradient is the single most common
  place a prototype stops looking like the client owns it.
* **Never** recolour the mark outside the approved mono and reversed versions · place the
  full-colour logo on the brand fill · stretch, rotate, outline or shadow it · redraw it.
* **Record provenance** — which URL each file came from. Confirm anything uncertain by fetching it
  again or searching for it yourself; nothing ships with an unverified source.

## Step 2b · Type — research the real face, then decide what you may legally ship

**Two separate questions, and conflating them is the mistake.** *What typeface does the client
actually use?* is research. *May we put that file in our prototype?* is licensing, and the answer is
usually no.

### Identify it — in this order

⚠️ **Fetch the linked STYLESHEET, not the page.** A page fetch returns converted text with no
`@font-face` in it — tried on a live client site and it came back with zero font information while
the site plainly loads webfonts. Read the CSS file the page links to, or use the browser.

1. **`<link>` to `fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=…`** — names the family outright, and tells you it
   is openly licensed. Best case; you are done.
2. **`@font-face` in the stylesheet** — `font-family` plus a `src: url(….woff2)`. The filename
   usually carries the family name.
3. **The loader domain names the foundry:** `use.typekit.net` / `p.typekit.net` → **Adobe Fonts** ·
   `fast.fonts.net` / `*.fontdeck` / Monotype paths → **Monotype** · `cloud.typography.com` →
   **Hoefler&Co**.
4. **Computed `font-family` on `body` and on a heading** — catches the case where the brand face is
   only used for display and the body is a system stack.
5. **Their brand or press page**, which often names the typeface in words.
6. **Ask.** Do not guess from a screenshot; a wrong guess propagates into every screen.

**Record what you found even when you cannot use it.** The style guide names the real face as what
production should license. That sentence is worth having in front of the client.

### 🔴 The licensing rule — identify the real face, ship an open one

**A webfont licence does not travel to us.** This is not caution, it is what the licences say:

* **Adobe Fonts cannot be self-hosted at all** and cannot be used by a third party — *"Adobe doesn't
  offer the ability to host fonts locally"*, and a client's site *"must load Adobe Fonts through
  their own Creative Cloud subscription"*. An agency cannot carry them into its own build.
* **Monotype webfonts are single-domain and metered** — a licence covers *"a single domain"*, runs on
  *"prepaid pageviews"*, and **agencies "may not share a single webfont license across multiple
  websites"**.
* **Google Fonts are open** (SIL OFL / Apache 2.0) — self-hosting, commercial use and redistribution
  are all permitted. This is why they are the fallback.

**So the rule, and it is not negotiable: never download and redistribute a client's licensed webfont
into our prototype.**

| What you found | What to ship |
| --- | --- |
| A Google Font | **Use it.** Link it or self-host it |
| Any other open face (OFL/Apache on GitHub or a foundry's free tier) | **Use it**, after checking the licence text itself |
| A licensed face — Adobe, Monotype, Hoefler, a bespoke foundry cut | **The closest open substitute**, with the real face named in the style guide |
| A display or script face used only in the logo | **Do not use it for UI at all.** It is a logo face; the body face is a separate question |
| Nothing identifiable | **Keep the system's own faces** and say so |

### Choosing the substitute — match the metrics, not the vibe

Two faces that "look similar" at 48px can wreck a 13px table. **Match, in this order:
x-height ratio · advance width · classification (grotesque / neo-grotesque / geometric / humanist) ·
stroke contrast · terminal style · whether it has tabular numerals**, which the system needs on
every number.

Starting points, **each to be verified by overlaying the two at the same size, never accepted from
this table alone**:

| Client's face | Open starting point |
| --- | --- |
| Helvetica / Helvetica Neue / Neue Haas Grotesk / Arial | **Inter** |
| Graphik, Founders Grotesk, Aktiv Grotesk | **Inter** or **Archivo** |
| Proxima Nova, Brandon, Sofia Pro | **Archivo** or **Figtree** |
| Gotham, Montserrat-adjacent geometrics | **Montserrat** |
| Avenir, Museo Sans, Nunito-adjacent humanists | **Nunito Sans** |
| Futura, Avant Garde | **Jost** |
| Circular, Poppins-adjacent geometrics | **Poppins** |
| DIN, Eurostile | **Barlow** or **Archivo Narrow** |
| Frutiger, Myriad, Univers | **Source Sans 3** |
| Tiempos, Georgia, a transitional serif | **Source Serif 4** |
| Garamond, an old-style serif | **EB Garamond** |

### ⚠️ A font swap invalidates the audit — re-measure

Changing the body face changes x-height and advance width, so it moves **apparent size, line length,
vertical rhythm and every fixed-width layout**. After the swap:

* **Re-run the contrast audit in both themes.** Contrast itself does not move, but perceived weight
  does — a lighter face at `--ink-3` can read thinner than the measured ratio suggests.
* **Re-measure fixed-width layouts.** A wider face is exactly what pushes a six-station rail back out
  of its container.
* **Check the numerals are tabular**, or every number in the system loses its alignment.
* **Check the four type sizes still hold their hierarchy** — a large x-height face makes 13px and
  15px look like the same size.

**🔴 Keep IBM Plex Mono regardless.** The mono is structural, not brand — it carries table headers,
eyebrows, KPI labels, timestamps and citation chips, and its 10.5px table header is a measured value.
Clients almost never have a brand mono, and swapping it changes the grid's register for no gain.
**Swap the body face; keep the mono.**

## Step 2c · Choose the expression — so it looks like this client, and only this client

**Four runs, four clients, one look.** With the logo covered, Pentland, ClickUp, Vermont and Topcon
were the same product in a different hue: the same gradient rail, white bar, glass cards and aurora.
The core is right to stay fixed — its measurements are why the apps worked. What was missing is a
decision about **how this client's product should feel**, taken from evidence and recorded.

**Set each dial from the identity sample (Step 1), the personas (0.4) and the inspiration board
(research question 6).** Every dial records its choice and the evidence that chose it, in an
**expression card** on the style guide.

| Dial | Options | Chosen by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chrome** | `brand` gradient rail · `ink` near-black chrome · `light` rail on the solid rung | The brand's light-to-dark balance and chromatic role. Dark-led or achromatic → `ink`. Colour-led → `brand`. Light-led with a restrained accent → `light`. |
| **Shell** | left rail · top navigation (`data-shell="top"`) · rail plus docked agent (`.with-agent`) | Number of top-level destinations (≤ 5 and a wide content area → top navigation works), how the client's own product navigates, the persona's session length. |
| **Surface** | `glass` · `solid` · `paper` | The client's own product (layered or flat), density (dense tools lean `solid`), the vibe line in §21. |
| **Default theme** | light · dark | Dark-led brands and dark-first personas (night shifts, control rooms) → dark; otherwise light. The product ships this default; the other theme stays one attribute away. |
| **Type voice** | display face = body face · a separate display face (`--font-display`) · display weight and size emphasis within the four-size scale | The client's display face (open or substituted, Step 2b) and how loud their headings are. |
| **Imagery** | product photography · people · illustration · data-led (no imagery) | What the client's own work shows and what the records have (styles with photos, shelves, people). Where records have images, every specimen shows them, with a real fallback. |
| **Motif** | none · one graphic element from the logo or brand work | Used once or twice, quietly: an empty-state illustration, the rail's top edge, a section divider, the AI marker. Never behind text, never a new colour. |
| **Chart voice** | bars and lines with gridlines · minimal with direct labels · dense small multiples | The personas (an executive reads big numbers and direct labels; an analyst reads grids) and the references. |
| **Signal** | the transformed accent (default) · the brand's literal accent as `--signal` | When the brand's own accent cannot be a fill under white text (neon lime, yellow, light cyan), keep it literal as `--signal` for indicators, focus glow on dark chrome, a key data series, selection marks — measured per use, never as body text on light. |

**Rules for the dials:**

- **The house default is a choice, not a fallback.** Picking `brand` chrome + left rail + `glass` +
  light needs evidence from the brand, the same as any other combination.
- **The logo-off test.** Cover the logo on the main screen and ask whether a person who knows the
  client would recognise it as theirs. If not, revisit chrome, surface, imagery and motif before going
  on. Record the answer in the expression card.
- **Two consecutive runs for different clients must not land on the same card** unless the evidence
  for both points there; the card states it.
- **What the dials never move:** the radius scale, the no-borders-on-cards rule, the two elevation
  levels, the four type sizes and two weights, spacing, component anatomy, every state, the status
  palette, the contrast floors. Variation lives in composition and colour application, never in
  breaking the measured core.

### Variants and the style set — options for the reviewer, one answer for the builder

Reviewers want choices ("show me another chart header"), and the builder needs one unambiguous answer.
Too many loose variants and the builder mixes them or picks the weakest. So variants are **coded,
capped and bundled**:

1. **Families.** Only these component families may carry variants: page header `PH`, record header
   `RH`, KPI tile `KPI`, chart frame and header `CH`, table row style `TB`, card `CD`, filter bar `FB`,
   empty state `ES`, and the signature components from 0.8 (`SG1`, `SG2`, …). Everything else has one
   form.
2. **At most three variants per family**, coded `<family>-<n>` (`KPI-1`, `KPI-2`, `CH-3`). Each must
   differ in a way a reviewer can see in one second (number above label vs label above number; header
   with inline legend vs legend below), and each passes every rule in this file. No variant is a
   weaker copy kept for contrast.
3. **At most three style sets**, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`. A style set names exactly **one** variant per family
   — never two. **S1 is the recommended set** and is the only set used on every screen of the style
   guide. S2 and S3 appear only in a **Style sets** section: the same two hero screens re-drawn with
   each set side by side, so the reviewer compares whole looks, not parts.
4. **Every specimen is tagged.** Each component instance carries `data-variant="KPI-1"` (and the screen
   carries `data-style-set="S1"`), and the style guide prints the code beside each variant in the
   component section.
5. **Machine-readable for the builder.** The file carries one JSON block, which the build contract
   quotes:

```html
<script type="application/json" id="style-sets">
{"active":"S1",
 "sets":{"S1":{"PH":"PH-1","RH":"RH-1","KPI":"KPI-1","CH":"CH-1","TB":"TB-1","CD":"CD-1","FB":"FB-1","ES":"ES-1"},
         "S2":{"PH":"PH-1","RH":"RH-2","KPI":"KPI-2","CH":"CH-2","TB":"TB-1","CD":"CD-2","FB":"FB-1","ES":"ES-1"}},
 "variants":{"KPI-1":"number over label, delta below, no icon","KPI-2":"label over number, sparkline right"}}
</script>
```

   **The rule for the builder: use only the active set's variant for each family, everywhere, and never
   mix sets.** If the reviewer picks S2, only `"active"` changes.
6. **Variants come from the brand and the references**, not from invention: each variant names the
   reference (research question 6) or brand evidence it came from in the `variants` text.

### Chart views — more than one way to see the same data

For every chart the document needs, start from the **question the chart answers** ("which stores
fail most?", "is the pass rate improving?") and draw **chart views**: the recommended view plus one or
two alternatives that answer the same question differently, each coded `CV-<chart>-<a|b|c>` and framed
in `.cv` with its code (`.cv-tag`).

- **Same frame, same data, same units, same status palette** across the views of one chart; only the
  encoding changes (bars ↔ dot plot ↔ line; stacked ↔ small multiples; donut never for more than three
  parts).
- **Mark one view Recommended** and say why in one line. The recommended view goes into the active
  style set's screens; the alternatives appear beside it in the chart section only.
- **Where the persona benefits, the view switch ships in the app**: a `.seg` in the chart header
  (Chart / Table at minimum, for accessibility and export), drawn in its states.
- **Every chart has a table view** available, even if it is not the recommended view.

**Black-led and achromatic brands** (Pentland: black grounds, white type, a neon yellow-green accent):
chrome `ink`, default theme usually dark, surface `solid` or `glass` over a near-black ground, the
accent kept literal as `--signal` for the active nav indicator, focus, selection and the one hero data
series. The primary button becomes a light fill with dark text, or the signal fill with dark text,
whichever measures ≥ 4.5:1 — never the signal under white. **An achromatic brand is never rotated
onto a hue taken from its website's link colour.**

**Brands whose hue is close to the house blue** (Topcon, H 208°): the transform barely moves anything,
so the expression has to carry the identity — chrome, surface, imagery, motif and type voice do the
work the hue cannot.

## Step 3 · Transform, preserving LUMINANCE

**The whole value of porting a validated system is that its measurements survive. They survive only
if you hold the right quantity fixed, and it is not the one in the colour picker.**

Contrast is a function of relative luminance alone. **HSL lightness is not luminance** — green at
L .40 is far brighter than blue at L .40. Measured on the Proofpoint port: holding HSL-L fixed while
rotating 207° → 176° took the primary from **4.54:1 to 3.12:1**, silently, on a token the document
prints a number for.

```python
import colorsys
def _lin(c): c/=255; return c/12.92 if c<=.04045 else ((c+.055)/1.055)**2.4
def Y(rgb): r,g,b=rgb; return .2126*_lin(r)+.7152*_lin(g)+.0722*_lin(b)
def hsl_rgb(h,s,l): return tuple(round(v*255) for v in colorsys.hls_to_rgb(h,l,s))

def reskin(rgb, hue, sat):
    """Saturation is CHOSEN (that is the muting). Lightness is SEARCHED. hue/sat/l in 0..1."""
    target, lo, hi = Y(rgb), 0.0, 1.0
    for _ in range(60):
        mid = (lo+hi)/2
        if Y(hsl_rgb(hue, sat, mid)) < target: lo = mid
        else: hi = mid
    return hsl_rgb(hue, sat, (lo+hi)/2)
```

⚠️ **Do not add a "drop saturation if Y is unreachable" fallback.** In HLS, lightness 1.0 is white at
every saturation, so every `Y` in [0,1] is always reachable; that branch can only fire spuriously,
on a tolerance tighter than integer-RGB rounding, and when it fires it flattens a colour to grey
while keeping its hue. `#86CDB4` came back `#BFBFBF`. **Saturation is chosen; lightness is searched.**

**Assign colour by job and keep the jobs separate:** brand/chrome · status · categorical ·
sequential.

* **The brand colour has exactly three uses** — the one primary action, the active nav item, the
  selected state. Not headings, icons, counts, or links in tables. Everything else greyscale.
* **Reserve the warm end for risk states** so a categorical colour never reads as an alarm. ⚠️ **If
  the brand itself is warm, Step 4 inverts this.**
* **Muting is a saturation cut, never a lightness cut** — a lightness cut moves the quantity you are
  holding. Worked example: blues → H176 at S × 0.70 (cap .62); the cerise family → H152 at S × 0.62
  (cap .44) for the gradient tail; positive → H138 against a green brand; amber → H28; red → H6;
  anything under S .06 left alone.
* **Four statuses, tonal only** — 8–10% tint, text at the 700 step, never a saturated fill.
  **Status always ships as icon + word + colour.**
* **Charts: one hue at several lightness steps.** Fixed hue order, never cycled.
* **🔴 Brand-as-accent and brand-as-fill are two different values.** White on the Proofpoint fill
  measured 4.15 against a claimed 4.94 — **the fill gradient runs one step darker than the accent
  token**, and it governs the primary button, user chat bubble, toggles, checked boxes, the current
  stepper node and the bulk-bar counter. **Check every gradient stop, not just the mid one.** In
  dark, brand-as-text lightens while brand-as-fill does not.

## Step 4 · The warm-brand checks (skip if the brand is cool)

Three things appear on a red or orange brand and on no cool one:

* **Negative status collides with the brand and no contrast figure will warn you.** A red brand and
  a red error measure 1.54 contrast — but contrast is a *lightness* metric and says nothing about
  categorical separation. **Measure ΔE.** At H 350 negative sits 26 ΔE from the brand against 90 ΔE
  in the blue original; **H 344 recovers 32 ΔE** and is about the ceiling before the error reads as a
  brand tint. Icon + word + colour becomes load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces.
* **The chart ramp must leave the brand hue entirely.** A six-step red ramp reads as six alarm
  levels. Send it cool — still one hue at several lightness steps, and it can never read as risk.
* **The accent needs more headroom.** A straight port put Titan's accent at 4.48 on the page, a fail
  where the blue measured 4.54.

## Step 5 · Both themes, and both reachable

**Light and dark are both deliverables. The mode you built in is not the only one that gets
checked.**

* **v3.3 shipped both themes and zero `<script>`**, so it silently followed the reader's OS and the
  reviewer only ever saw dark: *"do we not have light mode."* Two themes measured and argued over
  across a whole section, one of them invisible. **Shipping both is not enough — both must be
  *reachable*.**
* **A theme built by inversion fails on contact.** Light-mode brand hexes in a dark ambient field
  paint shadow instead of light; that is what blotched the first SailPoint dark mode.

**The style guide ships a theme switch** — built from `.seg` (D0), defaulting to the OS, remembered
in `localStorage`. **A screen built from the design system does not**, because a theme toggle in
product chrome is our scaffolding shipped to the client. On a product build, ship the **default theme chosen in
Step 2c, set explicitly as `data-theme` on `<html>`** — a product never follows the reader's OS (the
Topcon app opened dark on a dark-mode laptop while the design was light-first) — and **keep the other
theme's tokens live in the stylesheet**, so the second theme is one attribute away rather than a
rebuild. Users switch theme from the profile menu.

**Dark specifics — rebuilt in v5.** The v4 dark sat on a mid slate (`#192030`) under blue-grey glass at
12–23% and aurora at 19–26%. It read dull and muddy, and measured worse than it looked: composited on
its own tier-3 glass, `--ink-3` fell to 3.06:1 and the status tags to 2.98–3.43:1, which is why every
run lifted tokens by hand. The v5 dark, now in the stylesheet:

| Token | v4 | v5 | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--base` | `#192030` | `#0B1018` | A deep, faintly brand-tinted ground: depth comes from a dark page, not from grey washes |
| `--glass-1/2/3` | `rgba(120,165,225,.12/.17/.23)` | `rgba(150,180,230,.05/.07/.095)` | Glass in dark is a whisper of light; heavy alpha is what turned it to slate |
| `--glass-solid` | `#2F3D57` | `#151B26` | The opaque rung sits one clear step above the page |
| `--inner` · `--edge` · `--hair` | `.085` · `.17` · `.10/.17` | `.06` · `.10` · `.08/.14` | Quieter separations on a darker ground |
| `--ink` / `-2` / `-3` / `-mute` | `#D8E0EC` `#AAB7CB` `#9FADC3` `#78869F` | `#E7ECF3` `#B6C0CF` `#9AA6B8` `#6F7B90` | Worst composited case now 9.61 / 6.21 / 4.63 (mute is disabled text, exempt) |
| `--sp-blue` (brand as text) | `#6BB3EA` | `#7DBDF0` | 5.65:1 at its worst ground, up from 3.06 |
| Status text | `#AAB7CB` `#E3B45C` `#EC9790` `#86CDB4` | `#B6C0CF` `#E8BC69` `#F2A49D` `#8FD3BA` | Every status tag ≥ 5.0:1 on its tint over the opaque rung (was 2.98–3.43) |
| `--aur-1/2/3` | `.26/.19/.22` | `.18/.12/.14` | The aurora becomes a glow at the edges, not a wash over everything |
| `--vig` | to `rgba(6,11,22,.30)` | to `rgba(2,5,11,.42)` | Corners fall away, which is what makes the glow read |
| `.tile` highlight | white at 28% | white at 4.5% (dark only) | The 28% highlight painted every tile grey |

**Rules for dark, whatever the brand:**

- **Depth is lightness steps, not washes**: page < glass tiers < opaque rung < inner wells < raised
  overlays, each a small, even step lighter.
- **The brand glows; it does not tint everything.** Allowed: the aurora at the page edges, a soft
  brand glow behind the hero area or the agent launcher, the focus ring, the active nav indicator, a
  brand gradient on the primary fill. Not allowed: brand colour behind body text, saturated panels.
- **No fluorescent text.** Brand-as-text in dark is a pastel step of the brand (HSL lightness ≥ 0.70,
  measured); a neon or saturated accent is used for marks, indicators and fills with dark text, never
  for words on dark.
- **Edges catch light upward in dark and downward in light.** One hue carries two categorical steps
  in dark, three in light.
- **A container that HOLDS other glass takes the opaque rung**, or nested glass composites two rungs
  above its intended one and drags every ink token after it.
- **After the transform, re-measure the dark set on the brand's own hue.** A warm or green brand moves
  luminance differently from blue; the v5 numbers are the floor the port must still meet.
- **Look at references first** (research question 6): well-regarded dark products use near-black
  grounds, low-alpha surfaces, a single accent and generous spacing. Take that discipline, not their
  colours.

**Light specifics — it is not dark with the tokens flipped:** near-white brand tint base · **aurora
alphas roughly halved** · tier 1 `rgba(255,255,255,.72)`, tier 2 `.82`, tier 3 brand at 5% · inset
highlight `rgba(255,255,255,.9)` · shadows to the brand's darkest tone at 8–12% · **the accent glow
drops, replaced by a soft focus ring**.
⚠️ **A tinted light background changes the surface a chart was validated against** — Daikin's palette
passes on `#F4F8FC` and a third slot drops below 3:1 by `#EEF4FA`. Cap the tint and re-run the
validator. **Re-measure fixed-width layouts after restyling** — larger radii and padding are what
push a six-station rail back out of its container.

## Step 6 · Audit, composited, both themes

**Walk every text role with alpha composited over its real parent chain, in light and in dark.** The
reference run on v3.4 covered 35 new roles and ended with 3 under AA in each theme, all three
deliberately dimmed states.

**Mechanical checks, all pass/fail:**

* **Rendered and screenshotted in light AND dark.** A theme nobody has looked at is broken.
* `grep -o 'stroke[A-Z]'` → **nothing.** 79 camelCase SVG attributes once shipped in our own design
  language with every icon at browser-default stroke. **JSX takes camelCase; plain HTML takes
  kebab-case — same defect, opposite fix, both silent.**
* `grep -E '\-\-[a-z-]+: ?[0-9]+,[0-9]+,[0-9]+'` → every **bare rgb triple** accounted for. v3.4
  declares its ambient field as `--aur-a:0,51,161`, consumed as `rgba(var(--aur-a),a)`. **There is no
  `rgb(` to match, so a hex-and-rgba replace leaves the ambient field on the previous client's
  brand** — at 5% opacity it does not look broken, it just casts the page in the wrong hue.
* Card `border-width` computes 0 · gradient cards carry no inset ring · `backdrop-filter` computes
  `blur(...) saturate(...)`, not `none` · 1px top edge on every glass surface.
* Radii only {10, 6, pill, circle} outside the studio.
* Table header IBM Plex Mono 10.5px **and the face actually embedded** — if it silently falls back
  the whole grid loses its register.
* **If the body face was swapped (Step 2b): numerals are tabular, the four type sizes still hold
  their hierarchy, and no fixed-width layout has overflowed.**
* Tag font-size < button font-size · status tags ≥ 4.5 composited, both themes · **logo mark ≥ 3:1
  on its ground, every variant**.
* One `<style>`, one `</style>` · no horizontal page scroll · zero JS errors · **one output file**.
* **Theme switch correct under both OS schemes and across a reload.**
* **Narrow a filter until it returns nothing** and look at which empty state appears.
* **Shell, at the deepest scroll:** the rail's bottom equals the viewport's bottom, the top bar's
  computed background is opaque, no content is visible through or under it, and wide tables scroll
  inside their own container (no column clipped, no page-level horizontal scroll).
* **Every agent drawer opens, closes with Esc, returns focus to its launcher**, and is drawn over a
  real screen; no agent appears as a card or block in a page layout.
* **Images:** every record that has an image shows it; every missing image shows the designed
  fallback, never a broken-image icon or an empty card.
* **Status in charts** uses the status palette and a legend with words, never brand-colour steps.
* **Phone and tablet layouts** render at their widths with their own navigation.

**Four traps, each of which produced a false result on a real run:**

1. **Gradient grounds read as transparent.** A walker reading `backgroundColor` finds nothing on a
   `linear-gradient` surface and falls through to the page — it reported **1.03:1** on rail text that
   measures **12.12:1**. Put an explicit `background-color` under every gradient: honest measurement
   plus a real fallback ground.
2. **Alpha ignored.** Composite the tint over its actual parent or every tonal status tag reports
   ~1.2 and you "fix" what was never broken. **Measuring the wrong thing is its own failure mode.**
3. **🔴 Inject CSS before the LAST `</style>`, not the first.** The first may be the host page's own
   skeleton — the rules land outside the stylesheet, are stripped on export, and every component
   renders with browser defaults while the file looks complete and the elements are all present in
   the DOM. **This is written down and it still happened while building v3.4.** Verify a *computed
   value* on a new component — not the source text, not the presence of the element.
4. **A handler audit false-clears if `[data-theme]` is on `<html>`** — `el.closest('[data-theme]')`
   then matches every element. Exclude `document.documentElement`. Same trap in Playwright:
   `page.click('[data-theme]')` clicks `<html>` and your dark screenshot comes back light — select
   `button[data-theme]`.

### Rendering safety — what broke in real output files, and the rule for each

Every one of these produced a file that looked finished in its source and rendered wrong.

| What broke | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| **Words looked run together** (Vermont, "Retakeneeded") | **Fonts are embedded as base64 WOFF2 taken unchanged from Google Fonts' own files** for the subsets the page needs (latin, latin-ext, plus any script the personas read). Never re-subset, rebuild or convert a font. Some faces simply have narrow spaces — Plus Jakarta Sans measures 0.17 em in its official file, Archivo 0.21, Inter 0.28 — so judge the space against the official file, not an absolute floor. For a face with a space under 0.2 em: no negative letter-spacing below 15 px, and `word-spacing:.04em` on text under 14 px. |
| **Fonts silently fell back** when a run's sandbox could not reach Google Fonts, so its own screenshots showed Arial and the audit measured the wrong face | Embedding (above) makes the file truly self-contained. A `<link>` to Google Fonts is allowed only as a backup *in addition* to the embedded faces. `document.fonts` must report every family loaded before screenshots are taken. |
| **Unstyled studio parts** — the v4 stylesheet had no light-theme base rule for `.sheet2`, `.kpis2`, `.kpi2` or the studio composer `.cmp` | Fixed in v5's stylesheet. Any class the page uses must have a base rule; the render check lists classes with no matching rule. |
| **Broken images and empty image tiles** (Pentland's AI views, its material swatches) | Every image is embedded (SVG inline, raster as a data URI of 200 KB or less) — never hot-linked, since client sites block hot-linking and the file must open offline. Every image box has a size or `aspect-ratio`, `alt` text and a designed fallback. Keep the file under 15 MB. |
| **One open drawer covered the whole guide; a 100vh rail ran past its screen** | Screen specimens go in `.frame > .frame-scroll` (the kit). |
| **A phone drawn in a narrow box showed the desktop layout** | Phone and tablet specimens go in `<template class="device">` and render as iframes (the device script). |
| **The launcher sat on the phone's tab bar** | Fixed in the kit: on a phone the launcher sits above `.app-tabs`. |
| **Tags broke onto two lines in narrow tables** ("Off / track") | Fixed in the core: tags, facet chips and slots do not wrap. |
| **Clipped inputs and spilling cards** (ClickUp's search placeholder cut off, a Topcon hover card 149 px outside its column) | Placeholders fit their field at the narrowest width shown. State specimens (hover, lifted, open) sit in a cell sized for that state. The render check flags spills and clips. |
| **A transparent rail in some browsers** (`color-mix()`) | No `color-mix()`, CSS nesting or container queries in the system CSS; layout must not depend on `:has()`. |
| **Icons at browser-default stroke** (camelCase SVG attributes in HTML) | The `stroke[A-Z]` grep above, before every hand-over. |

**The render check — run it in the browser on the finished file, in light and in dark, at 1,280 px and
375 px, and paste the result into the hand-over.** It also walks every device iframe. Every count must be
zero and every face loaded; `where` names the first offenders. `overlaps` finds siblings that collide
(pills on top of each other, task names running into the next card); `squeezed` finds text wrapping at
one or two words per line (a column or card too narrow for its content).

```js
(() => {
  const res = { hScroll: 0, spills: 0, clipped: 0, overlaps: 0, squeezed: 0, brokenImages: 0, fonts: {}, unstyledClasses: [], where: [] };
  const note = (k, el, doc, win = window) => { res[k]++; if (res.where.length < 15) res.where.push(k + ': ' + (win.frameElement ? (win.frameElement.title || 'device') : 'page') + ' › ' + el.tagName.toLowerCase() + '.' + [...el.classList].join('.') + ' "' + (el.textContent || '').trim().slice(0, 40) + '"'); };
  const scan = (doc, win) => {
    const de = doc.documentElement; res.hScroll = Math.max(res.hScroll, de.scrollWidth - de.clientWidth);
    const texts = [];
    const layer = el => { for (let n = el; n && n !== doc.body; n = n.parentElement) { const p = win.getComputedStyle(n).position; if (p === 'fixed' || p === 'absolute' || p === 'sticky') return n; } return doc.body; };
    for (const el of doc.querySelectorAll('body *')) {
      const cs = win.getComputedStyle(el); if (cs.display === 'none' || cs.visibility === 'hidden') continue;
      const r = el.getBoundingClientRect(); if (!r.width || !r.height) continue;
      if (['hidden', 'clip'].includes(cs.overflowX) && el.scrollWidth > el.clientWidth + 2 && el.clientWidth > 40 && cs.textOverflow !== 'ellipsis' && !el.closest('.tblwrap')) note('clipped', el, doc, win);
      const p = el.parentElement;
      if (p && cs.position !== 'fixed' && cs.position !== 'absolute' && win.getComputedStyle(p).overflowX === 'visible' && r.right > p.getBoundingClientRect().right + 4) note('spills', el, doc, win);
      const own = [...el.childNodes].some(n => n.nodeType === 3 && n.nodeValue.trim());
      if (own) {
        if (cs.display !== 'inline' && cs.display !== 'contents') texts.push([el, r, layer(el)]);
        const lh = parseFloat(cs.lineHeight) || parseFloat(cs.fontSize) * 1.3, lines = Math.round(r.height / lh), words = el.textContent.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
        if (lines >= 3 && words / lines <= 1.6 && words >= 3) note('squeezed', el, doc, win);
      }
    }
    for (const parent of doc.querySelectorAll('body *')) {
      if (parent.matches('.faces')) continue;
      const kids = [...parent.children].filter(k => { const cs = win.getComputedStyle(k); return cs.display !== 'none' && cs.visibility !== 'hidden' && cs.position !== 'absolute' && cs.position !== 'fixed' && k.textContent.trim(); });
      for (let i = 0; i < kids.length; i++) for (let j = i + 1; j < kids.length; j++) {
        const ra = kids[i].getBoundingClientRect(), rb = kids[j].getBoundingClientRect();
        const ix = Math.min(ra.right, rb.right) - Math.max(ra.left, rb.left), iy = Math.min(ra.bottom, rb.bottom) - Math.max(ra.top, rb.top);
        if (ra.width && rb.width && ix > 3 && iy > 3) note('overlaps', kids[j], doc, win);
      }
    }
    res.brokenImages += [...doc.images].filter(i => i.complete && !i.naturalWidth).length;
    const c = doc.createElement('canvas').getContext('2d');
    doc.fonts.forEach(f => { const fam = f.family.replace(/["']/g, ''); c.font = `16px "${fam}"`; res.fonts[fam] = { status: f.status, spaceEm: +((c.measureText('a b').width - c.measureText('ab').width) / 16).toFixed(2) }; });
    const css = [...doc.styleSheets].flatMap(s => { try { return [...s.cssRules].map(r => r.cssText) } catch (e) { return [] } }).join(' ');
    [...new Set([...doc.querySelectorAll('[class]')].flatMap(e => [...e.classList]))].filter(k => !css.includes('.' + k) && !res.unstyledClasses.includes(k)).forEach(k => res.unstyledClasses.push(k));
  };
  scan(document, window);
  for (const f of document.querySelectorAll('iframe')) { try { if (f.contentDocument) scan(f.contentDocument, f.contentWindow); } catch (e) {} }
  console.table(res); return res;
})()
```

Treat `spills`, `clipped` and `squeezed` in the style guide's own documentation tables as leads to
check; in screen specimens they are defects, every one. `unstyledClasses` should list only hooks used
by a script, never a visual component. The v5 runs measured 69–381 squeezed elements and up to 54
clipped ones per file; the reference test page measures zero on every count.

## Step 7 · Ship

**The output is one file: a single self-contained HTML file, and nothing else.** Not a published
artifact, not a separate token file, not a logo folder, not JSON or Markdown alongside it. Save it as
`<client>-design-system.html` in the outputs folder and hand over that path. Everything the four
deliverables below describe lives inside that one file as sections of the page — the token block as a
copyable code block, the logo kit as inline SVG (raster variants as data URIs) with a copy button per
variant, the build contract as a quotable block. If something cannot live inside the file, it is not
delivered.

**Four deliverables, all inside the one file:**

1. **Living style guide** — the page itself: self-contained, the full section set, light and dark with
   a working switch. Doubles as the visual spec the build prompt points at. **Its
   order:** build brief and manifest → expression card and inspiration board → the demo-storyline flow
   and every journey flow (0.7) → signature components (0.8) → the app shell for each role and device →
   every screen, in its shell → agent drawers (0.9) → overlays (modals and drawers, all sizes) → chart
   views → style sets (S1, S2, S3 compared) → foundations and components → port note, ledger,
   build contract, hand-over. Carry: the view manifest from 0.6 with a link to every specimen ·
   the swatch and its provenance · the token block · type scale · glass tiers · ambient field · every
   component **rendered, not described** · the table toolbar with all four states including
   filtered-empty · the AI Insight card · the container doctrine.
2. **Token block** — one `:root`, tokens named by **job** never by colour, **a measured ratio printed
   beside each**, non-text ones marked. A token carrying a number nobody re-measured after a hue
   rotation is a defect.
3. **Logo kit** — the seven variants with the usage matrix, clear space, minimum sizes, misuse list
   and provenance. With `ink` or `light` chrome, the rail takes the variant that measures on it (the
   reversed mono on `ink`, the full-colour horizontal lockup on `light`).
4. **Build contract** — a short block on the page, written for the builder (Nebula), that the build
   prompt quotes verbatim. It carries:
   - **Shell:** use `.app`, `.app-rail`, `.app-top`, `.app-main`, `.app-body` from the kit; the rail is
     full height at every scroll position; the top bar is opaque and gains `.scrolled` on scroll; set
     `data-chrome`, `data-surface` and `data-theme` on `<html>` exactly as the expression card says.
   - **Agents:** every agent uses the `.agent-drawer` opened from a top-bar button and `.agent-launch`,
     **built on the platform's live agent/chat component** with streamed replies and real stages.
     Never an automation that writes the answer into an object for the page to show on refresh. Tool
     outputs (charts, tables, files, citations, proposed actions) render inside the thread.
   - **Data:** tables scroll horizontally inside `.tblwrap`; every image has a fallback; counts shown
     in two places come from the same query. Tables follow the density rules (one line per cell, two
     chips then "+n", long text in an expanded row or drawer, about seven columns at 1,280 px).
   - **Style set:** the `#style-sets` JSON block, quoted; use only the active set's variant for each
     family, on every screen; never mix sets. Chart views: the recommended view, with the Chart / Table
     switch where drawn.
   - **Overlays and spacing:** modals and drawers only in the three sizes and one anatomy; the agent
     docks only at 1,440 px and wider; spacing only from the scale; `data-density` as the persona
     row says.
   - **Colour:** no colour value outside the token block; status series in charts use the status
     palette; deltas are coloured by good or bad, not by sign.
   - **States:** every screen ships its empty, filtered-empty, loading, error, no-access and UNSET
     states as drawn.
   - **Roles and devices:** each role's shell and navigation as drawn; phone and tablet layouts as
     drawn.

**And a type note:** the client's real typeface named, what was shipped instead, and why — *"Brand face
 is Gotham (Monotype, single-domain licence); shipped Montserrat as the closest open substitute.
 Production should license Gotham."* **A client reading that learns something; a silent substitution
 looks like we did not notice.**

**Plus a port note on the page itself**, stating the source version, max |ΔY| across all colours, and
every decision the port forced, **the brand source order applied, the expression card, and every
correction made to the scoping document (0.1)**. **Anchor the one branded surface to the client** — with
`brand` chrome the rail gradient starts at the sampled swatch; with `ink` chrome the signal colour marks
the active item; with `light` chrome the brand marks the active item and the primary action.

**Swap the sample domain, not the doctrine.** Proofpoint: Deal Gate → Quote Builder; gate artefacts
→ product configuration / pricing summary / legal review / order form; identities → seats; Okta IG →
Defender for O365; Stage 20/40 → awaiting approval / approved. **Every measurement stayed.**

⚠️ **Anonymise at extraction: the format travels, the client name does not.** The file is the
hand-over; do not publish it or share it as a link.
**If you fix something in the stylesheet, say so in the hand-over** — an unreported fix means
the next run reintroduces it and the skins quietly diverge.

# REFERENCE

## The view library — the reserve the app draws from

**Everything below is held, not always built.** Phase 0 selects which of these a given build uses; the
rest stay dormant. A view the library does not carry is a view the app can never produce, so the
library is deliberately wide. Each view-type is either a **component** (built once, configured per use)
or an **engine + type catalogue** (one renderer configured to many outputs chosen by data shape).

**Four of these are engines, not single components.** Charts, graphs, flows and maps each build *once*
as a renderer plus the shared palette (see "The visualization engines" below), then produce the long
lists of types under them by configuration. Do not hand-build forty chart components; build the chart
engine and configure it.

`[in kit]` = a class or pattern already exists in the stylesheet / REFERENCE above — reuse it, never
write a second one. `[NEW]` = add to the reserve when a build first needs it, built from the tokens and
doctrine, never with new colour values.

### Data & record views
- **Table / data grid** `[in kit]` — rows of records; the default list surface. Every table gets the toolbar (search left, facets right) and the filtered-empty ≠ empty rule from the Components doctrine.
- **Editable data grid** `[NEW]` — inline-edit cells, add/remove rows; config and ops tools.
- **Tree-table / hierarchy grid** `[NEW]` — expandable parent-child rows; BOMs, categories, org data.
- **Card gallery / tile grid** `[in kit]` — scannable cards (`.tile`, `.g2c`/`.g3c`), image or metric-led.
- **List (one / two / multi-line)** `[in kit, partial]` — dense line items with optional meta and actions.
- **Description / key-value list** `[NEW]` — label:value pairs for one record's attributes.
- **Grouped / sectioned list** `[NEW]` — items under collapsible section headers.
- **Leaderboard / ranking** `[NEW]` — ordered list with rank, score and movement.
- **KPI / scorecard tiles** `[in kit]` — headline numbers with delta (`.tile`, `.loop`); never colour a delta by arithmetic sign, colour by whether the movement is good.
- **Detail / inspector panel** `[in kit, partial]` — one record, deep; third-pane per container doctrine.
- **Master–detail / split view** `[in kit, partial]` — list on one side, record on the other.
- **Compare / diff view** `[NEW]` — two or more records or versions side by side; quote vs quote, before vs after.
- **Pivot / cross-tab** `[NEW]` — values across two dimensions; roll-ups.
- **Matrix / heatmap grid** `[NEW]` — colour-graded cells for coverage, risk, utilisation (sequential palette, never colour alone).

### Charts — the chart engine, configured
Build the chart engine once (`.chart` frame already owns card, title, unit, legend placement and
no-data state). Configure it to these types, chosen by the question the data answers. Grouping is the
selection rule.

- **Comparison** — bar, column, grouped/clustered, stacked, horizontal bar, bullet, lollipop, radar/spider, parallel coordinates.
- **Trend over time** — line, multi-line, area, stacked area, streamgraph, step, spline, slope, **sparkline** `[in kit]`, candlestick/OHLC.
- **Part-to-whole** — donut (pie sparingly), stacked bar/area, treemap, sunburst, icicle, marimekko, waffle/pictogram.
- **Distribution** — histogram, box plot, violin, ridgeline/density, dot plot, strip/beeswarm.
- **Relationship / correlation** — scatter, bubble, connected scatter, heatmap, hexbin, contour.
- **Flow / magnitude** — funnel, waterfall/bridge, sankey, chord, arc, alluvial.
- **Single value / KPI** — gauge/radial, bullet, progress ring, big-number stat with delta.
- **Specialised analytics** — cohort grid, retention curve, control chart, pareto, polar/wind-rose.
- **Geospatial charts** — choropleth, symbol/bubble map, heat overlay, flow map (these hand off to the map engine).

A chart without a stated unit is decoration. The ramp follows the palette rules (fixed hue order,
never cycled) and the shared data-viz palette below.

### Relationship & graph views — the graph engine, configured
One node-edge renderer with switchable layouts (force / hierarchical / radial / grid). Nodes, edges and
their labels are components with full states (hover, selected, disabled) like any other control.

- **Node-link graph / network** `[NEW]` — entities and links; context graphs, entity resolution.
- **Tree / hierarchy** `[NEW]` — parent-child, expandable.
- **Org chart** `[NEW]` — reporting / role structure.
- **Mind map / concept map** `[NEW]` — radial idea structure.
- **ER / schema / data-model diagram** `[NEW]` — tables and relations; data and integration apps.
- **Dependency / lineage graph** `[NEW]` — what feeds what; impact analysis.
- **Adjacency matrix** `[NEW]` — a dense graph shown as a grid.
- **Knowledge-graph / taxonomy explorer** `[NEW]` — browse a large entity graph.

### Process & flow views — the flow engine, configured
One node-and-edge flow renderer with shape and layout styles. This is the view a workflow app needs;
without it, a "show me the workflow" BRD collapses to a table. Nodes carry state (active, done, blocked)
reusing the stepper's pip and status tones.

- **Workflow / flow diagram (DAG)** `[NEW]` — nodes, edges, branches, conditions; generated from the data.
- **Classic flowchart** `[NEW]` — start / decision / process / end shapes.
- **Swimlane / BPMN-style** `[NEW]` — steps grouped by actor or system.
- **Sequence / interaction diagram** `[NEW]` — ordered exchanges between parties.
- **State-machine diagram** `[NEW]` — states and transitions; order lifecycle, approvals.
- **Decision tree** `[NEW]` — branching logic to an outcome.
- **Data-flow diagram** `[NEW]` — how data moves between stores and processes.
- **Journey map / service blueprint** `[NEW]` — stages, actions, back-stage systems.
- **Approval / escalation chain** `[NEW]` — who signs off, in order.
- **Stage board / pipeline** `[in kit, partial]` — items through fixed stages (`.loop` is the seed).
- **Stepper / wizard flow** `[in kit]` — ordered, forward-moving task (`.sth`, `.stv`).
- **Kanban** `[in kit]` — states a person moves items between, can go backwards (`.kb`); needs a non-drag alternative (WCAG 2.2).
- **Agent run / reasoning trace** `[in kit, partial]` — steps taken, tools called, inputs considered (`.stages` is the seed).

### Spatial views — the map engine, configured
One map renderer with layers (shape / tile), marks (markers / bubbles / heat / routes), clustering,
interactive legend, zoom/pan and drill-down.

- **Map / geospatial** `[NEW]` — choropleth, markers, heat, routes; country → region → point drill-down.
- **Canvas / whiteboard / freeform** `[NEW]` — place-anywhere nodes and connectors.
- **Floorplan / layout editor** `[NEW]` — positioned elements on a 2D plan.
- **Network topology** `[NEW]` — infra / devices and links (graph engine on a spatial frame).
- **Resource / slot / seat map** `[in kit, partial]` — pick-one from a spatial layout (`.slot`).
- **Mini-map / overview** `[NEW]` — zoomed-out navigator for a large canvas or map.

### Temporal views
- **Calendar (month / week / day / agenda / slot)** `[in kit]` — three shapes are doctrine (`.cal`, `.agenda`, `.slot`); add week/day when needed. Today takes a ring, selection takes the fill, never both on one cell.
- **Timeline (horizontal / vertical)** `[NEW]` — events along a line; history, roadmaps.
- **Gantt / schedule** `[NEW]` — bars across time with dependencies; projects, plans.
- **Resource / scheduling grid** `[NEW]` — rows of resources against a time axis.
- **Roadmap** `[NEW]` — initiatives across quarters / lanes.
- **Activity feed / history** `[in kit]` — newest-first log (`.feed`); a change carries its reason.
- **Audit log** `[NEW]` — immutable record of who-did-what-when.

### Conversational & agentic views
- **Agent drawer** `[in kit]` — the default home of every agent: right drawer (overlay), wide drawer, docked third column, full screen on a phone (`.agent-drawer`); see "The agent component" below. The agent speaks first; loading is a sequence, not a spinner.
- **Agent workspace (full page)** `[in kit, partial]` — only when the agent IS the screen's purpose (a dedicated "Ask" page); a centred column around the composer (`.canvas`). Never on a dashboard or record page.
- **Agent workbench** `[NEW]` — the agent's work as structured, inspectable output, not only a chat log.
- **AI insight card** `[in kit]` — inferred-vs-stated, grounded, per-row confidence, one row deliberately excluded with its reason (`.ai:not(.msg)`).
- **Reasoning / trace view** `[in kit, partial]` — expand `.stages` into a full step-by-step trace.
- **Tool-call inspector** `[NEW]` — what the agent called, with inputs and outputs.
- **Prompt console / playground** `[NEW]` — prompt in, response out, with controls.
- **Suggestion / support-prompt rail** `[NEW]` — recommended next inputs (reuse `.chips`).
- **HITL approval / action diff** `[NEW]` — review what an agent will do before it acts; the modal container is for the irreversible ones.
- **Citation / grounding panel** `[NEW]` — the sources behind an AI answer.

### Document & artefact views
- **Document / report reader** `[in kit, partial]` — long-form, sheet-on-shell (studio is the seed).
- **Rich-text editor** `[NEW]` — compose formatted content.
- **Form / data entry** `[in kit]` — all controls, validation (`.fld`, `.ctl`).
- **Form-builder / schema view** `[NEW]` — define fields and rules visually.
- **Spreadsheet-like grid** `[NEW]` — formulas, cells, selection.
- **Code / log / JSON viewer** `[NEW]` — monospace, foldable, syntax-aware (IBM Plex Mono is already structural).
- **PDF / file preview** `[NEW]` — render a document inline.
- **Media / file gallery** `[NEW]` — thumbnails, preview, upload.
- **Slide / deck view** `[NEW]` — paged presentation surface.
- **Redline / track-changes / comparison** `[NEW]` — document diff with comments.
- **Artefact studio** `[in kit]` — two-pane generate-and-review shell (`.studio2`).

## The component inventory — every atom, every state

The views above are built from these atoms. **Reuse the stylesheet class whenever one exists**
(the single most common failure on this work is a second implementation — mixed radii, two kinds of
search field). Build a `[NEW]` atom from the tokens and the Form/Components doctrine above, never with
new colour values and never outside the five-step radius scale.

### Full inventory (grouped as the major systems group theirs)
- **Actions** — button (primary/secondary/tertiary `[in kit]`: `.btn-p/.btn-s/.btn-t`), icon button, button group, split button, FAB, link, menu button.
- **Text & number inputs** — text field `[in kit]`, textarea `[in kit]`, number stepper, search field `[in kit]` (`.field`), tag/token input, rich-text, OTP/pin.
- **Selection inputs** — select `[in kit]`, combobox / autocomplete, multi-select, checkbox `[in kit]` (`.opt .box`), radio `[in kit]` (`.opt .dot`), switch/toggle `[in kit]` (`.tog`), segmented control `[in kit]` (`.seg`), slider / range, rating.
- **Date & specialised inputs** — date picker, time picker, date-range, color picker, file upload / dropzone.
- **Status & display** — badge, count / notification dot, status pill/lozenge `[in kit]` (`.tag` tones), tag/chip `[in kit]` (`.chipsel`), avatar `[in kit]` (`.av`), avatar group `[in kit]` (`.faces`), icon, pictogram, progress bar `[in kit]` (`.prog`), progress ring, skeleton, spinner.
- **Containment** — card `[in kit]` (`.g1/.g2/.g3`), panel, accordion / collapsible, tabs `[in kit]` (`.tabs`, + vertical), tile `[in kit]`, inset / well `[in kit]` (`.inner`), section.
- **Overlays** — tooltip, popover, dropdown menu `[in kit, visual]` (`.menu` exists; the trigger/dismiss/focus behaviour does not), context menu, modal / dialog, drawer / side-sheet `[in kit, doctrine]`, bottom sheet (mobile only), toast `[in kit]` (`.toast`), inline alert / banner (`.note` is the seed), command palette, coachmark / tour.
- **Navigation** — app / top bar, side nav / rail `[in kit]`, breadcrumb `[in kit]` (`.crumb`), pagination `[in kit]` (`.pg`), tabs `[in kit]`, stepper `[in kit]`, tree nav, back / forward.
- **Feedback & states** — empty `[in kit]` (`.empty`), filtered-empty `[in kit]`, error, loading / skeleton, progress, notification centre, inline validation `[in kit]` (`.ctl.err`, `.hint.e`), UNSET (the fifth state, already doctrine).
- **Form helpers** — label `[in kit]`, hint / helper text `[in kit]` (`.hint`), validation message `[in kit]`, fieldset / field group.

### The universal state + anatomy rule
**Every interactive atom — including the new views' controls — ships and is audited across the full
state set, and names the token it uses in each:**

```
STATES   default · hover · focus-visible · active/pressed · selected · disabled · loading · error · read-only
DECLARES border width · border colour · radius · background · elevation · the token for each state
```

The stylesheet already does this for `.ctl` (`.focus/.err/.warn/.off`). The rule is to make it a
requirement for *everything*: a graph node, an edge, a map marker, a flow step, a timeline event and a
kanban card all have hover / selected / disabled states, and all take their values from tokens, the
five-step radius scale and the two-level elevation — never a one-off. An atom that looks unfinished is
almost always one missing its focus-visible ring, its disabled tone, or its selected treatment.

---

## Foundation additions (so the new views render correctly)

These extend the existing foundations; they do not replace Step 3's transform or the radius/elevation
rules. Apply them with the same "only hue moves, measurements survive" discipline.

- **Semantic token tier.** Colour by job through a semantic alias layer (primitive → semantic →
  component), so the reskin in Step 3 is a near-mechanical swap and the hardcoded gradients and focus
  rings (`.btn-p`, `.msg.me`, `.tog.on`, the `rgba(0,113,206,…)` rings) stop slipping past the port.
  This is the clean fix for the bare-triple and gradient-stop traps already in Step 6. It also makes
  density and multi-theme a file swap rather than an edit.
- **Density modes.** Compact / default / spacious driven by spacing + line-height tokens only, set by
  the Phase 0 persona. Component structure never changes; only the spacing tokens move.
- **`backdrop-filter` / forced-colors / reduced-transparency fallback.** The glass identity depends on
  `backdrop-filter`. Define the solid-surface fallback (the opaque rung already exists for nested dark
  glass — extend it) so glass degrades to legible flat cards under `prefers-reduced-transparency`,
  Windows forced-colors, and browsers without the filter. This is correctness: without it the page is
  unreadable washes, not a softer look.
- **WCAG 2.2 interaction checks (add to the Step 6 audit).** Target size ≥ 24×24 (buttons, pips, map
  markers, slot chips, graph nodes), focus appearance (indicator size + contrast), focus-not-obscured
  (sticky headers, banners and the floating copilot must not cover the focused element), and a non-drag
  alternative for kanban and any drag view.
- **RTL / logical properties + script fallback.** Use CSS logical properties (`inline-start`, `inline`,
  `block`) so one stylesheet mirrors for Arabic/Hebrew; mirror directional icons (chevrons, back/next,
  progress) and not others (clocks, media); tolerate text expansion (German +35%, Arabic +25%) without
  hardcoded widths; add Arabic/CJK font fallback stacks, since Archivo and IBM Plex Mono cover neither.
  Relevant to Gulf and Japan clients; the stylesheet is physical-direction today.
- **Elevation + z-index ladder.** Two elevation levels stay; add a named stacking order
  (base < sticky < dropdown < drawer < modal < toast < tooltip) so overlays and the new views' popovers
  never fight.
- **Motion intent scale.** Keep the 120–160ms restraint and "nothing else moves"; add a small
  duration+easing token scale, an intent label per motion (orient / confirm / emphasize) and a ≤100ms
  feedback-onset floor — so an agent or flow view's motion reads as reasoning, not latency.
- **The visualization palette (shared by chart, graph, flow and map engines).** Beyond the existing
  "one hue, several lightness steps": categorical / sequential / divergent / threshold palettes as
  separate jobs, colour-blind-safe pairs (test under deuteranopia), never colour alone (pair with
  label / shape / texture), and a data-table alternative for every chart. This one palette is what
  colours all four engines; build it once.
- **Iconography + node-glyph sourcing.** Source icons from one open, licensed set (same discipline as
  the typeface licensing in Step 2b — e.g. an OFL/MIT set), plus the node / marker / edge glyphs the
  graph, flow and map engines need. Icons are ad-hoc inline SVG today; name the set in the style guide.

### Parked, by decision (named so nothing is lost)
Revisit after the core is in. Not on the critical path for a POC: DTCG token JSON export (Figma /
Tailwind interop) · multi-brand / white-label theming · locale number/date/currency formatting +
pseudo-localization · onboarding tours / first-run / consistent-help affordance · a UX-writing /
microcopy system · print / PDF / email-safe rendering · a changelog + deprecation states for the base
system · executable tooling (token inventory/diff, contrast/ΔE, Playwright theme screenshots) ·
aesthetic flexibility beyond glass (a glass / flat / solid treatment dial — decide deliberately, it
risks the signature look).

## Form — the parts people get wrong

* **No borders on cards.** Separation is elevation and tone, never a line. Hairlines *inside* a card
  — row separators, a divider between two regions — are fine; the rule is about the card's outline.
* **A card carrying colour gets exactly one treatment** — gradient wash alone, **or** solid tint plus
  one inset hairline. Never both. A gradient already says "selected"; a ring on top of it is the most
  common violation, and it shows up most on selected options inside a chat input. A solid tint
  without a ring reads as a flat slab, which is why the inverse holds.
* **Corner radius is a fixed five-step scale. Never improvise a value.** **10px** everywhere — cards,
  tiles, containers, inputs, selects, buttons, panes, drawers, modals, table containers · **6px**
  small inner elements — tags, chips, code · **pill** for toolbar search, facets and accent pills ·
  **circle** for avatars and account logos · **studio only** shell 28 / canvas 22 / sheet 16 /
  tile 12, because a 10px corner on an 1,100px object reads as a cut rather than a form. **Never
  8/12/14/16 outside that scale, and never a mix on one page** — mixed radii are the single most
  common reason a build reads as unfinished. ⚠️ A blanket flatten to 10px was tried on the SailPoint
  wireframe 22 Sept 2026 and reverted within the hour. **Do not re-propose it.**
* **Ambient aurora in the brand theme, never flat grey.** Layered low-opacity radial blooms
  distributed down the page so a long document does not go flat below the fold. Percentage-sized
  radials on the body; avoid `background-attachment: fixed`, which bands in full-page captures.
  **Dense internal tool: 3–4% maximum, two or three blooms, page body only** — never behind a table
  or a side pane, which take a solid near-white ground so rows stay legible.
* **Glass in three tiers plus a nested rung**, with a **1px inset top highlight** — that detail is
  what sells it as light catching an edge. Nested `inner` surfaces instead of a second bordered box
  is what stops a UI looking cheap.
* **Two elevation levels, never a third.** Resting and raised. Rows do not lift on hover; they change
  tone.
* **Four type sizes, two weights** (400/600), `tabular-nums` on every number. **The mono face is
  structural, not decorative** — table headers, eyebrows, KPI labels, citation and version chips take
  it; body copy never does. If the mono is not actually embedded the headers fall back silently and
  the whole grid loses its register.
* **One icon weight, two sizes** — 16px in tables and chips, 18px in nav. Stroke 1.6.
* **Motion is 120–160ms ease-out on panes, drawers and tonal hover, and nothing else moves.** No
  count-ups, no card entrance animations, no skeleton shimmer.
* **Tags are quiet and smaller than the smallest button** — 11–11.5px against a 13–14px button,
  tonal, no border, no sentence inside. A tag states a fact; it must never read as pressable.

## Components — the doctrine, not just the class

* **Every table gets a toolbar**: search left, filters right, nothing in the middle, **above and
  outside** the card (the card is the table's **ground**, not its container). The search **reports
  its result beside itself — "4 of 7"**. Three or four facets (D8), drawn from the visible rows so a
  facet can never offer a value returning nothing. Applied filters are removable chips with one
  *Clear all*.
  **⚠️ A filtered-empty table is NOT an empty table and they must never share a state.** *"No rows
  match your search and filters"* with a clear action is a different fact from *"No opportunities at
  Stage 20 yet"* with a create action. **Showing the second when the first is true is the single most
  common table bug and it makes working software look broken.** A static reference matrix — a
  discount-authority table, a legend, a key-value spec block — is not a record list and takes no
  toolbar.
* **Pagination is built once and reused.** The range names the **total** ("1–10 of 47"), reflects the
  filter, disables rather than hides at the ends, and does not appear under ~25 rows.
* **Every AI or system-generated insight goes in a labelled AI Insight card** — subtle brand
  gradient, one CTA inside the same card, overflow behind a chevron, never by growing the card or
  truncating mid-sentence. The user must always be able to tell what the data *says* from what we
  *inferred*. **Reference: Topcon's approval-suggestion step** — a *"Suggestion only — you decide"*
  chip, a grounding line naming the source SOP and precedent set, per-row confidence, a reason per
  row, **and one row deliberately excluded with its reason shown.** Copy that shape.
* **Kanban** is for states a person changes and items that can move *backwards*. Fixed-order work is
  a **stepper**. WIP limits shown in the attention tone. The drop zone is **the one dashed edge we
  allow**, because the dash means something; every other dashed edge is decoration.
* **Calendar has three shapes** — month grid ("when is it free"), agenda ("what is happening"), slot
  picker ("commit to one"). Shipping a month grid when the user must choose a *time* is the common
  version of this mistake. Today takes a ring, selection takes the fill, **never both on one cell**.
  A taken slot is struck through and disabled, **never hidden** — hiding it makes a busy day look
  empty.
* **A person is a record, not a string.** Person card or face stack anywhere a human is named. Cap
  the stack at three faces plus a count; the overflow chip is a count, not an avatar; initials, never
  a generic silhouette.
* **An activity feed is not a stepper** — a stepper's shape is known in advance, a feed's is not.
  Newest first, mono timestamps, actor and object bold but not the verb, automated entries say
  "System", and a change carries its reason. A history that records *what* without *why* gets
  re-litigated in a meeting.
* **Chart frame:** the system owns the card, title, **unit**, legend placement and no-data state; the
  ramp and marks follow the palette rules and the `dataviz` skill. A chart without a stated unit is a
  decoration. **Never colour a delta by its arithmetic sign** — colour it by whether the movement is
  good, and name the comparison period beside it. **A series that encodes a status (pass / fail,
  on track / off track) takes the status palette and a worded legend**, never steps of the brand
  colour — Vermont's pass-rate chart showed Fail, Needs attention and Pass as three blues.
* **Container doctrine:** **modal** only for irreversible or legally significant acts (withdraw,
  reject with mandatory reason, e-signature, stop ship) — blocking is the point, never nested, never
  holding a scrolling table · **right drawer** (~480px, dismissible) for configuration attached to
  the current record · **third pane** (persistent, resizable, pushes rather than overlays) for the
  inspector, whose whole value is surviving a move to the next row · **stepper** where the *order* is
  part of the meaning · **full page** only for objects deserving a shareable URL · **inline expand**
  for hierarchies · **bottom sheet** never, on desktop.
* **A control sits inside the boundary of what it changes** — no divider between an active tab and
  the panel it governs. **Named exception: the table toolbar**, above and outside the card.
* **Header carries identity, navigation context, notifications, profile. Nothing else.** No role or
  persona switcher — a visible `Planner · CSR · Manager · Auditor` control tells the client instantly
  this is a mock, and real RBAC is an attribute of the signed-in user, so role switching lives in the
  profile menu. No theme toggle, no demo-path control. A quiet scope indicator is fine.
* **Left nav: logo → navigation → profile at the bottom**, on the chrome the expression chose
  (`brand` gradient, `ink` or `light`), full height at every scroll position. With a top-navigation
  shell, the same order runs left to right.
* **The top bar is opaque.** Content scrolls under it without showing through it.
* **One composer per surface. One right-hand rail, not two** — assistant and inspector share it as
  two modes; opening the assistant swaps the mode and remembers the inspector's state.
* **The agent component — always a drawer, never a card on the page.** Pentland's Range Copilot was
  built as a full-width block on Home, wired as an automation that wrote answers into an object the
  page showed after a refresh. That is not an agent. The rule:
  - **Where it lives.** A right-side **drawer** (`.agent-drawer`, ~440 px) that slides over the page
    without reflowing it — the default on every internal page. It opens from a **top-bar button**, the
    floating **launcher** (`.agent-launch`) and a keyboard shortcut, and closes with Esc, returning
    focus. Variants, each for a reason: **wide** (720 px) while an answer carries a chart or table;
    **docked** as a third column (`.app.with-agent`) for personas who keep it open all session;
    **full screen** on a phone; **studio region** inside a two-pane artefact studio (interface left,
    conversation right, no card); **full page** only when the agent is the screen's whole purpose.
    One drawer at a time; it shares the right-hand side with the inspector as two modes.
  - **Anatomy, top to bottom.** Header: the agent's name, a scope chip (read-only, or what it can
    act on), expand / dock / close. Context chips: the record or page it is looking at. Thread: agent
    left, person right; the agent speaks first with three suggested prompts from the person's own data.
    Working stages while it thinks (`.stages`), named by what it is really doing. Answers rendered with
    their tool outputs — chart (chart engine, with unit), in-thread table, file card, citation chips
    with the evidence hover card, record links — each marked AI-written. Proposed actions as a
    **human-in-the-loop card** (`.ad-action` with `.ad-diff` before → after, approve and reject with a
    required reason). Dock: suggestion chips **outside** the composer, then the composer.
  - **Every state:** closed (launcher with an unread dot when the agent has something), opening, empty
    first run, thinking (stages), streaming, answered, partial answer with a gap named, refused (out of
    scope, with what to try instead), tool failed (which step, retry), offline, and read-only.
  - **How it is built.** On the platform's **live agent/chat component** — streamed replies, real
    stages from the agent run, tool outputs rendered as they arrive. Never an automation that stores
    the answer in an object for the page to pick up on refresh. The build contract says so.
  - **AI on a page is not the agent.** A dashboard may carry an **AI insight card** (`.ai:not(.msg)`)
    that summarises and links "Ask about this" into the drawer, and a field may carry an AI-draft
    marker with an inline assist. The conversation itself always opens in the drawer.
  - **Loading is a sequence, not a spinner** — a copilot that shows its stages reads as reasoning, a
    spinner reads as latency. **The agent speaks first.**
* **No stacked sublines under headers, no redundant preview data.** One header, one line of support
  at most, and only if it carries something the header does not. Show data by the priority of the
  flow the user is in on the screen they are on.
* **A fifth data state: UNSET.** Beyond empty / loading / error / populated — **a field belonging to
  a journey the user has not completed shows as visibly unset, never a seeded default dressed as
  their own answer.** On one build this produced a cost one-pager reading $26,250 against an actual
  $55,550 and a visit "booked" for March 2011, while the Next card told her to plan the visit the
  one-pager said was already booked.

## Layout, spacing, density and overlays — the rules the v5 screenshots broke

Every rule below comes from a screenshot of a v5 output. They apply to every screen specimen.

**Spacing.**
- Only the spacing scale (`--s-1` 4 px to `--s-12` 48 px). Page padding 24 px (16 px on a phone),
  24 px between sections, card padding 20 px (16 compact, 24 comfortable), 8 px between related
  controls, 4 px between a label and its value. No other values.
- **Equal rhythm inside a row of cards**: the same padding, the same order of parts (eyebrow → value →
  support line), top-aligned. A label that wraps to two lines must not push its value below its
  neighbours' (image 1: "Candidates in pools" pushed 77 down) — shorten the label or let the eyebrow
  row reserve two lines across the whole row.

**Filling the space — no dead areas.**
- **A row fills its width.** Tile rows use as many equal columns as tiles (3, 4, 5 or 6) across the
  full content width. Two-panel screens split 8/4 or 7/5 of a 12-column grid. A row that leaves a
  large empty area on the right, or a card with a large empty area below its content, is redesigned:
  move a related panel into the gap, or let the content take the width.
- **Headers carry their actions on the title row.** Page header: title left, primary action right,
  same line. Record header: ID eyebrow, title with status tags, one meta line; actions right-aligned on
  the title row — never floating in their own row with empty space beside them (image 5).
- **Definition lists** (`.dl`) use a label column of 120–160 px, never wider (image 5's 250 px label
  column left a channel of white).
- **Specimen height fits the content.** Device specimens size to their content; a fixed height only
  when the screen scrolls by design.

**Density — what fits in a cell, a card, a column.**
- **Tables: one line per cell by default; at most two in the first column** (name over one muted line).
  Longer text is truncated with an ellipsis and the full value in a tooltip, or moves to an expanded row
  (`.row-x`) or the detail drawer. **No paragraphs in cells** — image 4's reasons paragraph and
  four-row sub-score breakdown belong in the expanded row.
- **At most two chips per cell, then "+n"** (`.cell-chips`, `.more`). One status tag per cell. Nothing
  in a cell overlaps or leaves its cell (image 4: a source pill sat on the "Approved" chip; the status
  tag was cut off at the table edge).
- **Column budget at 1,280 px: about seven columns.** More columns → a column picker, a frozen first
  column (`.tblwrap.freeze`) and horizontal scroll inside the table. Minimum widths: ID 96 px, name
  200 px, status 120 px, number 80 px, date 104 px. Numbers right-aligned in tabular figures.
- **Cards in narrow columns** (kanban, lists): a card is at least 240 px wide and holds at most four
  lines — title, one meta line, one status, one blocking or next-action line. No two-column layout
  inside a card narrower than 320 px. Long status text truncates (image 2: "Feedback 2 days overdue"
  left the card; "No feedback yet" wrapped to three lines).
- **Row heights follow density**: 36 / 44 / 52 px for compact / default / comfortable, set by the
  persona (0.4), never mixed on one screen.

**Copy inside specimens.**
- **Never show field names, query syntax or rule expressions as text** — image 1's tiles read
  "status = open" and "interview_count > 0". Write what the person needs: "of 11 jobs", "3 with
  feedback overdue".
- IDs in mono only where the person really uses them (a requisition number), never as decoration.

**States never move the layout.** Hover, selected, focus and active change colour, shadow or an inset
ring — never padding, size, alignment or border width (image 1: the selected "On hold" tile grew a
thick border and centred its text).

**State variants of a screen** (empty, loading, error, filtered-empty, no-access) are drawn **one per
row, each at real width** in its own device, or — when only the content region changes — as the
content region alone at its real width. **Never several full app shells side by side** (images 3 and
6: three shells in one row left a 200 px content area and one word per line).

**Overlays — one system** (kit: `.modal`, `.drawer`, `.agent-drawer`, `.ov-hd/.ov-bd/.ov-ft`):

| Overlay | Width | Height | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modal S | 420 px | content, max screen − 64 px | confirm an irreversible act |
| Modal M | 560 px | content, max screen − 64 px | a short form |
| Modal L | 760 px | content, max screen − 64 px | review or compare before committing |
| Drawer S | 420 px | full height | the agent; a quick peek |
| Drawer M | 560 px | full height | record detail, inspector, filters |
| Drawer L | 760 px | full height | the agent with a chart or table; a long form beside the list |
| Agent docked | 420 px column | full height | only at 1,440 px and wider |

Same header (title, one line of support, close), same body padding, same footer (secondary actions
left of primary, primary last on the right, a destructive primary in the negative tone). One overlay
at a time; a drawer never opens a modal on top of itself except to confirm. Image 7's agent filled
most of the screen because it was a docked column at 1,280 px; the kit now forbids it.

## The use-case dial

Same system, same components, both themes. What moves is restraint, ground and radius scale.

| Use case | Ambient | Ground | Radii | Colour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dense internal tool** (PLM, config, ops console) | aurora 3–4%, 2–3 blooms, body only | solid near-white behind tables and side panes | 10 / 6 / pill | brand on primary action, active nav, selected — nothing else |
| **Client-facing demo surface** | full aurora, blur 58–70px, vignette | glass tiers 1–3 | 10 / 6 / pill / circle | brand gradient on the nav rail; one accent pill |
| **Artefact / document studio** | quiet — the canvas is the subject | sheet white on a tinted shell | 28 / 22 / 16 / 12 | greyscale plus one brand accent |
| **Dark-first ops console** | blooms *lighter* than the page | opaque rung for any container holding glass | 10 / 6 / pill | brand-as-text steps up; brand-as-fill holds |
| **Ported screens from another build** | inherit the host | — | **normalised, see below** | inherit |

**Ported code gets one card, imposed from outside.** Screens from a separate build each bring their
own idea of a card — on the Enroll · Belong canvases there were **six paddings, four radii and three
shadows** between them, invisible one screen at a time and obvious the moment a dozen stack in one
column. **Do not edit them one by one.** One normalising block at the end of the ported stylesheet:
one radius, one surface, one shadow · **three padding tokens only** — a card you read into, a row
inside a card, a compact cell · a card holding rows takes **no padding of its own** and its rows
carry the rhythm · **media cropped to one aspect ratio** (`height:auto` on an illustration is how two
cards in a row end up different heights) · **restate the selected and status rings after the
normaliser** or the reset eats them · check the containers too — the agent's note, the stepper and
the action bar must sit in the **same column** as the cards.

## The defect register — re-derived on the system itself

**⛔ A figure asserted about the system from a measurement taken on a PORT of it is not evidence.**
One "defect" was recorded that way — a claim that §14's chart ramp fails its own 2.60 figure — and
had to be **withdrawn**: measured across all twenty triples, the best is exactly 2.60, and the dark
pair is exactly 4.24, both as the document claims. A luminance-preserving port makes this trap
worse, not better, because the port's numbers genuinely are the source's, so a wrong number looks
doubly confirmed. **Check every "the file says" against the file.**

The standing lessons, all derived from defects on the record:

* **White on the brand fill** — check every gradient stop, not just the mid one.
* **`.ai` vs `.msg.ai`** — an unscoped insight-card selector captures every agent chat turn.
* **Nested glass in dark** — a container holding glass takes the opaque rung.
* **A theme with no switch** follows the reader's OS and half your work is invisible.
* **Bare rgb triples** survive any regex port.
* **A wrong number in a document is not a wrong colour.** Correct the number.

**Added in v5, from the Pentland, ClickUp, Vermont and Topcon runs:**

* **Same core, same look** — with the logo covered the four apps were one product. The core stays
  fixed; the expression (Step 2c) must differ, with evidence.
* **An agent on a page** — Pentland's Copilot as a full-width block, fed by an automation and a
  refresh. Agents live in the drawer, on the live agent component.
* **A brand decided outside the file** — three runs settled a hue conflict with a "standing decision"
  from the calling flow; Pentland's black-and-lime brand shipped electric blue. Only the brand source
  order decides.
* **Must-haves moved to future scope** — Pentland's material compare, detail pane and docked Copilot
  were L1 and were dropped. Every L1 ID maps to a manifest row.
* **Journeys never drawn** — refusals, approvals and counters were in the scoping document and nowhere
  on the page. Every journey is a flow (0.7).
* **Status as brand steps** — Vermont's chart showed fail and pass as shades of blue.
* **A rail that stops, a bar you can see through** — layout defects in the build that the kit and the
  build contract now prevent.
* **Personas without screens** — Vermont's merchandiser had no phone or tablet layout reachable from
  any shell.
* **A dull dark** — mid-slate grounds and heavy glass; failing contrast on its own tiers. Rebuilt.

**Added in v5.1, from the first v5 runs and their review screenshots:**

* **Screens at the wrong width** — "1,280 px" screens drawn in a narrower column took the desktop
  layout at half width: state screens one word per line, a docked Copilot covering the page. Every
  screen is now a device at real width, scaled.
* **Overlays of every size** — modals and drawers improvised per run. One overlay system, three sizes.
* **Dense tables and cards** — paragraphs, four-row breakdowns and stacked pills in cells; two-column
  layouts in 240 px kanban cards. Density rules with hard limits.
* **Dead space** — half-empty rows, actions floating in their own row, a 250 px label column.
* **Implementation leaking into copy** — "status = open" as a tile's support line.
* **Unbounded variants** — options with no codes and no way for the builder to pick one coherently.
  Coded variants, at most three style sets, one active.

## The finished-piece rule — no rework after hand-over

**What this skill hands over is the final piece.** The person receiving it should be able to use it
as it is: open the style guide, take the token block, drop in the logo kit. A run takes as long as it
needs. Never hand over a partial build, a "first pass", or a list of things still to do.

**Before handing over, check every item below. Fix anything that fails and check again. Repeat until
the whole list passes.**

1. **Complete, checked against the manifest.** Go through the view manifest (0.6) row by row. Each
   row's link must land on a drawn specimen with the client's own content, never lorem ipsum, a
   containers-table row or a "same layout" note. Check this with a script, not by memory: list every
   manifest anchor, confirm each exists, and confirm each section holds rendered markup for the item.
   Every agent output from 0.3 has its specimen too. Every section of the style guide is built.
2. **No leftovers.** Search the output for `TODO`, `TBD`, `FIXME`, `lorem`, `[UNVERIFIED]`,
   `placeholder`, `XXX`, "still to come", "waiting on", empty `href`s and empty sections. None remain.
   The one allowed exception is the labelled UnifyApps stand-in logo, and only under the conditions in
   stop 2.
3. **Every fact settled.** Every gap from research has been closed by your own search, or decided and
   recorded as `[DERIVED]` with its reason. Nothing is left as an open question for the user to answer
   later, except the two stops.
4. **Every state.** Each selected component shows every state in the universal state rule, in both
   themes.
5. **Both themes measured.** The contrast audit has run in light and dark, every failure is fixed, and
   the measured ratios in the token block match the rendered page.
6. **Looked at.** The page has been rendered and screenshotted in both themes and at phone width, and
   you have looked at the screenshots. Nothing overlaps, clips, overflows or renders unstyled.
7. **Works.** The theme switch, tabs, links, copy buttons and any interactive views work. The page
   loads with no console errors.
8. **Consistent.** Token names, the port note, the build brief and the style guide agree with each
   other. Every number stated in one is the number used in the others.
9. **In scope.** Nothing the BRD put out of scope appears. Dormant views stay dormant and are listed
   as not built.
10. **Sources recorded.** The port note lists every source used, with its date, including any search
    done after `research` failed, and every logo URL tried.
11. **Hand-over on the page.** The three hand-over answers (below) are written in the style guide's
    last section, not only in the chat reply.
12. **Research done to depth.** Every row in the research ledger has met its minimum: searches run,
    official source found, second source for deep facts. The ledger is in the port note.
13. **Every journey drawn.** Every journey in the scoping document, and the demo storyline, is a
    flow on the page with a frame per step and per exception, using the document's own wording for
    refusals and messages. Count journeys in the document and flows on the page; they match.
14. **Every L1 feature and CMP ID covered.** A script lists every must-have feature ID and component ID
    in the document and finds each in the manifest's reference column. None missing.
15. **Signature components in depth.** Each one shows anatomy, every state, the data variants,
    interactions, responsive behaviour and at least two variants.
16. **Agents in drawers.** Every agent has its drawer drawn open over a real screen, with its own
    outputs; no agent sits in a page layout; the build contract names the live agent component.
17. **The expression is decided and visible.** The expression card records every dial with its
    evidence and the logo-off answer; the inspiration board shows what each reference changed; the
    brand source order applied is in the port note.
18. **Every persona has a shell.** Each persona's screens are reachable from a drawn shell at its
    device widths, phone and tablet included where the document names them.
19. **Build contract on the page**, matching the expression card and the kit classes used.
20. **One file, rendering clean.** The output is a single self-contained HTML file with fonts and
    images embedded. The render check (Step 6) returns zero page scroll, zero spills, clips, overlaps
    or squeezed text in any screen specimen, zero broken images, every font loaded and matching its
    official file, and no unstyled component class — in light and dark, at 1,280 px and 375 px. Every
    screen is a device at its real width.
21. **Overlays consistent.** Every modal and drawer uses a kit size and the shared anatomy; no other
    widths; the agent docks only at 1,440 px and wider; the launcher hides while a drawer is open.
22. **Layout and density rules hold.** No row with a large dead area, actions on the header's title
    row, one line per table cell (two in the first column), at most two chips per cell, cards within
    their four-line budget, no field names or query syntax in copy, states that do not move the
    layout, state variants one per row at real width.
23. **Variants coded, one active set.** Variants exist only for the listed families, at most three per
    family, coded; at most three style sets; S1 on every screen; the `#style-sets` JSON block present
    and quoted in the build contract; every chart has its coded views with one Recommended and a table
    view.

**Show the result.** The hand-over reply lists all twenty-three items with pass and one line of evidence
each (for example "1 · pass · 23 of 23 manifest rows link to drawn specimens"). An item that cannot
show evidence has not passed.

**A run that skips a step fails here.** No brief, no manifest, no ledger, no flows, no expression card
or no checklist on the page means the piece is not finished, whatever else it contains. The time a
run takes is not a reason to cut research depth or drawing — a run that was told to hurry still meets
the minimums and says how long it took.

**A failure found here is fixed here, not reported as a known issue.** Only something that genuinely
cannot be fixed inside this run (the client's logo file does not exist anywhere) goes into the
hand-over, with the reason.

## Hand it over with these three answers

Write them in the style guide's last section and repeat them in the reply.

> **What is the WOW factor here? Name it in one sentence.**
> **What would the client push back on first?**
> **What is the weakest part, and do you know it?**

**Answering the third honestly is not a confession, it is the deliverable.** A hand-over that names
its own weakest part gets fixed; one that hides it gets found.
